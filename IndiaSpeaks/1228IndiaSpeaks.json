     "selftext": "The typical Indian mentality and the path of Hinduism, or the Vedic path of spiritual progress, is one of great individuality and freedom for each person to decide what they want or what is best for their own spiritual development. Thus, it is typical for Hindus to work on their own, not necessarily as a group. There is nothing wrong in that. It is the last of the great cultures that promote the utmost freedom for the individual. But, yet, there is a great need that is not being met, and that is the need for Hindus / Dharmists / Devotees, especially in India, to unite and work together as a group, or even as a whole society, in order to continue to preserve and protect their own culture, traditions, and certainly the freedom of the individual.\n\nThis freedom is being threatened in many ways today, although there are those who either refuse to admit it, refuse to see it, or are hesitant to work together to save it. This blindness and hesitancy must be overcome.\n\nThroughout India, for example, there are portions of the population that belong to particular religions, such as Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, etc., and they often work as a strong section of society to protect their rights, freedoms and traditions. Especially Christians and Muslims vote as a block to promote and vote into office particular politicians they favor, and who favor them. They also will create an uproar when something happens against them, or when someone desecrates their religious texts. They hold demonstrations or even riot when a mosque is threatened. Thus, they get there way, or at least people begin to hesitate before doing something that will make them upset.\n\nHowever, it seems that the Hindus are the most apathetic in this regard. Though they are increasingly beginning to wake up to the importance of being heard and making themselves be noticed, they are still, for the most part, letting their influence and the power of numbers that they have as the majority of the Indian population simply slip through their fingers.\n\nIt is time we learn that apathy is a disservice to Dharma and society. It accomplishes nothing, if that is not obvious. It lets the needs of the Dharmic society go unnoticed. The point is, if we do not take care of ourselves, no one else will. And there are people counting on that apathy to get their way and do things against the well-being of the majority Hindu population. And we are letting them get away with it. This hurts those who follow Vedic Dharma, and takes away the confidence that people need to maintain their practice of the Dharma.\n\nThose who say that Sanatana-dharma is eternal and, thus, there is no need to worry about the future, do a great injustice to the Vedic cause and to humanity. Those who say that Vedic culture has lasted for thousands of years and will continue to last for thousands more show a poor excuse for apathy. Though it is eternal, which is the meaning of Sanatana, this does not mean that it will always remain a prevalent force on the face of the earth. It can also decline into obscurity if we let it.\n\nThose who feel that there is nothing to worry about need to understand why the Bhagavad-gita was spoken. Arjuna did not want to fight, and who does? No one wants war, at least if they are in their right mind. But how many people of particular religions cry for war, or jihad, toward anyone who is not a part of their religion? Arjuna wanted to leave the battlefield and go to the forest to meditate, as if that would solve all of his problems. But Lord Krishna said he was acting foolishly. Lord Krishna told Arjuna that he should indeed fight, but fight for what? He was to fight to uphold the Dharmic principles that the Kauravas were neglecting. Lord Krishna specifically went to the Kauravas to try and arrange a diplomatic means to keep everyone happy and prevent war, but they would not listen. Finally, there was no alternative but to fight. And so the sides were drawn against those who fought for Dharma and those who fought for their own agenda.\n\nWe could also say that we should simply let the good Lord take care of everything. If something is meant to be, then the Lord will take care of it. But that is not the result nor the premise of the Bhagavad-gita. Lord Krishna showed that everything may rest on Him as pearls are strung on a thread, but we all must do our part. It is up to us to protect Dharma if we are indeed expecting to continue to have the freedom to practice and follow it.\n\nVedic culture has been attacked for the last 1200 years. India\u2019s history can easily show that. And it was the heroes of India, and the millions of average everyday people of India, Hindus, who gave their lives and underwent severe torture that kept Vedic Dharma alive for future generations, and for the freedoms that we have today that allow us to continue these traditions. Are we now to let those freedoms die, after so many sacrificed their lives for us, for Vedic Dharma? This would be a great dishonor to their memory and for the cause they fought for. We cannot allow this to happen, but we also need to be aware of the warning signs of what is happening around us.\n\nThis is why, with a growing Muslim population in India, and all over the world for that matter, Hinduism in India could be dead in another 100 years. Just by their high birth rate alone Muslims are increasing their presence in India. Thus, one hundred years from now Vedic Dharma may only be practiced in small pockets here and there, such as in various holy places, as long as the majority Muslim population allows it. The fact is that history has shown that Muslims have a very low tolerance for anything that is non-Muslim. You can see this in the ever decreasing non-Muslim population in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Arabia, etc., etc. They have never allowed complete freedom for non-Muslims in any Islamic country, and have passed laws against them and persecuted them and destroyed their temples and monuments, kidnapped and raped their women, and killed thousands of Hindu or Christian men. So, why should we expect India to be an exception? They have already shown what they did in India.\n\nA rising Muslim minority in India does not have to become a majority to begin changing laws in their favor, but simply by being a noisy and disturbing minority they will gain the upper hand. Increasing their political maneuvering will give them political clout and power. And when they do come closer to being a majority, they will certainly increase the persecution of an infidel Hindu population until they are finally extinct.\n\nOver 400,000 Hindu Pandits were chased out of Kashmir, and what was done about it? Take notice of how Assam is becoming the new Kashmir with nearly 80,000 people being displaced, having left their villages due to fear from the incoming and growing Muslims. And now the Muslim political party in Assam is demanding a separate and autonomous region in southern Assam just for Muslims. Is this not the same pattern we have seen time and time again? And is anyone doing anything about it? Is anyone speaking out that another chunk of India is threatened with being lost? In due course, what will be left of India if this keeps happening?\n\nEven now the Muslims of India, though they have a Hindu ancestry, no longer identify themselves as Indians but as members of the house of Islam. Thus, they are only taking care of unfinished business from their previous invasions and war against Hindus. Hindus often do not conduct themselves in a powerful way. And when they do, the Indian media is completely against them. The secular media in India does not mean secular, it means to bend over backward showing preference for the minorities at the expense of the Hindu majority. Thus, secular media in India means to be anti-Hindu. But should that stop Hindus? They cannot afford to be overly considerate of what others think when their own future is at stake.\n\nThe next ten to 15 years will be a major turning point and show the deciding factor for the future of Vedic Dharma on the face of the planet, particularly in India. The thing is, even now we practically have more freedom to practice Vedic culture in America than we do in India, in its own homeland. Will America be one of the final strongholds for Vedic Dharma? Will we have to one day export it back to India from America?\n\nTherefore, we have to ask ourselves, will our temples still be here in India in another 40 to 50 years? Or will they gradually disappear because of Christian conversion tactics, Muslim persecution against Hindus, or because corrupt politicians who care little about Vedic culture take over temples to possess and sell their assets for the money? Hindu temples are known for being income producers, for the most part. While the Indian government cares little about possessing churches and mosques because they need funds, they use more money than they bring in. It is the temples that are income producers because of the Hindu majority population that give to them.\n\nTherefore, there is no doubt that Hindus must unite as a society while there is still time to make a difference.\n\n**CHANGES THAT NEED TO TAKE PLACE**\n\nThe time to act is now. Some of the things Hindus / Dharmists / Devotees need to do include:\n\n1. Hindus must unite and vote as a bank in all elections to oust those who disregard Hinduism and vote in those who do. They must never take an election for granted. They have done so in the past with terrible results.\n\n2. Hindus must get involved in politics in various ways to help direct the actions of the government.\n\n3. India must also change its politicians in order that it as a nation takes a stronger stance against those who try to bring India down, and to take a stronger stance to defend itself militarily. India cannot afford to be a wimp. There is a need for younger leaders who are more aware of how to fulfill the needs of India.\n\n4. Hindus must work to unite all Hindus. They must wake up other Dharmists about the need to take action. This may be a daunting task, but let everyone become involved in the action plans that will make a difference for their future, for their culture, for preserving their tradition, for protecting the rights and freedoms of the individual, and certainly for the well-being of their children. Work for the freedom to continue to construct and manage their own temples without interference from the government.\n\n5. The spiritual leaders and acharyas must reach out to the villagers and people of all classes in order for the people to feel cared for, and that they are a part of and belong to the Dharmic tradition and are welcome in the temples. They should feel that they are not neglected, but that they are wanted and needed in the greater cause for Vedic Dharma.\n\n6. Indian Hindus must take care of their own people, those who are poor, destitute and disadvantaged, or others will. And those others are often quick to try to convince them of the shortcomings of Hinduism, and, thus, through the guise of welfare activities, try to convert the poor into leaving Vedic Dharma and become Christians or something else. It is true that those who convert for material facility are not strong converts because they could just as easily convert back to what they were once their financial status improves. However, if a child is converted and stays in that fold for 10 to 15 years, it is not likely they will ever want to reconvert back to Vedic Dharma after being a Christian for so long. Thus, from that generation forward, that family will likely continue to be non-Dharmists. Children of converted families who remain outside of the Dharmic fold for that length of time will have little impetus to change.\n\n7. All Dharmists must be educated in their own culture, philosophy, and tradition to understand it clearly, and know how to explain it to their children and others. Thus, they can also be convinced of the deep and profound nature of what they already have, and be less likely to ever want to convert to something else.\n\n8. When anything in the media appears to depict Vedic culture in a poor light, or when someone like a politician says something against one of the Vedic Divinities, there must be an immediate outrage or lawsuit established against such a person or incident. If people begin to see that an immediate and strong reaction takes place whenever Vedic Dharma is poorly or inaccurately portrayed, or when someone denigrates the Bhagavad-gita or one of the Vedic texts, they will begin to hesitate or even stop before doing such things in the future.\n\n9. There must be regular programs at temples for the education of all, and book distribution to help spread Vedic spiritual knowledge to everyone far and wide.\n\n10. Everyone should engage in a cultural revolution in which we promote the true understanding of Vedic Dharma. This is one of the best ways to spread the beauty and freedom found in the lofty spiritual knowledge that can attract everyone. Westerners are especially and increasingly being drawn to the beauty of this spiritual path. So, Indians should have no doubt of its potency and work to maintain India as the homeland of a dynamic and thriving Vedic tradition.\n\n11. Dharmists / Hindus must work to do service for their temples and community to take care of everyone and maintain what they have, namely their temples, their right to peacefully observe the Vedic ways, and care for the people who turn toward the Dharmic path.\n\nSuch changes can only take place if Hindus unite and stand strong for Dharma and work together. We have to drop the apathy, discard our ego, along with ethnic and class distinctions and join together under one identity and for a primary cause. We must act like Arjuna did after having received the instructions of Lord Krishna to stand and fight for Dharma rather than going off into the forest to get away from everything and meditate, as if that would solve his dislike to do battle against those who had chosen the side of adharma.\n\nIf Hindu Dharmists do not do this, and remain as they are, being apathetic and inactive, it is but a prescription for a slow extinction. They may lose it all, certainly the freedom to choose what they want to be. Only we can change the future by being pro-active and united in this way. Then Sanatana-dharma will remain on the face of the earth as a path that we have the freedom to follow. Do we want to see Vedic Dharma as the tradition of the majority population in India in another 100 years, or will it become a thing of the past, like a museum piece? This is what has happened to the Maya, Inca, Egyptian civilizations, and many others. The choice of what happens in the future is ours by how we get together under Santan Dharma. Let's get united to save our next generation.",

     "selftext": "Savarkar had entered the Cellular Jail a passionate promoter of Hindu\u2013Muslim amity, having, among other things, lavished fulsome praise on the Muslim heroes of 1857 such as Awadh ruler Wajid Ali and Rohilkhand rebel chieftain Khan Bahadur Khan. But he came out of prison driven by a desire to remake his country in the name of Hindutva or Hindu nationalism \u2013 the Indian nation seen as a nation based on Hinduness.\n\nWhat explains this change of heart? Part of it may have been due to Savarkar\u2019s experiences in the Andamans. His interactions with the jailer Barry\u2019s Pathan, Baluchi and Sindhi lackeys had left him bitter. The British believed that any staffers belonging to India\u2019s majority community might be sympathetic to political prisoners, most of whom were Hindus, and so only Muslims were tasked with supervising the inmates. To Savarkar these overseers appeared fanatical and overzealous, and not just in their mistreatment of the prisoners. They also converted non-Muslim prisoners to the Islamic faith by way of threats, coercion and inducements. Savarkar described the Pathans, Baluchis and Sindhis as the most fundamentalist of Muslims he met in prison, followed by the Punjabis. The Tamil, Marathi and Bengali Muslims in prison were neither cruel nor anti-Hindu, but the others would taunt the Hindus as \u2018kafirs\u2019 (infidels), he said.\n\nWhen Savarkar was shifted to Ratnagiri prison in 1921, he reported seeing the same Islamic practices there and wrote, that year, inside his prison cell, a tract titled Hindutva, regarded as the seminal text for Hindu nationalists. It was then that the term \u2018Hindutva\u2019 entered India\u2019s political lexicon \u2013 but it acquired entirely different meanings for different groups. For believers in a Hindu Rashtra it was, and is, the earliest and clearest delineation of their theory of Indian nationhood, inextricably linked to the country\u2019s purported Hindu ethos and history. For those prizing India\u2019s absorption of multiple faiths and cultures and its assimilation even of confrontational forces as its distinguishing essence, it was, and is, the defining text of exclusionary divisiveness and the scapegoating of non-Hindus, especially Muslims.\n\nVarious saints and political leaders from Swami Vivekananda to Dayanand Saraswati and Lokmanya Tilak had publicly called for a Hindu revival before Savarkar did. The major difference was that Savarkar defined his idea of a Hindu resurgence in political terms, not religious. He defined the nation as based on the unifying Hinduness of its people. And called as much for a combative spirit as a cohesive one if India were to retain its essence, which in his opinion was its Hindu civilization and Hindu way of life.\n\nAt the very outset, Savarkar made it clear that Hindutva was not the same as Hinduism. It had nothing to do with religion or rituals. The term in English which came closest to the one he was using, he wrote, was perhaps Hinduness. As a principle, Hindutva formed the basis of India\u2019s national character, he maintained, and, to provide greater clarity, offered his own definition of who was a Hindu. The word Hindu was as ancient as the Vedas, he contended, and explained that the letter \u2018Sa\u2019 in Sanskrit was often turned into \u2018Ha\u2019 in the Prakrit languages. Thus the land of the people known as the Sapta Sindhus, which had acquired for itself the name Sapta Sindhu, was referred to as \u2018Hapta Hindu\u2019 in the Avesta of the ancient Persians, he said.\n\nSavarkar wasn\u2019t really setting out to create a Hindu nation. India was, he asserted, citing some ancient and medieval texts, a Hindu nation in an organic sense. (To those who argued that no Sanskrit text mentioned the word Hindu, he replied that it was \u2018ridiculous to expect a Prakrit word in classical Sanskrit\u2019 and cited the example of Banaras, which too was non-existent in Sanskrit as it was the Prakrit word for the Sanskrit \u2018Varanasi\u2019. He held out some other Prakrit words such as Jamuna, Sia and Kishan too as examples.) And anyone who considered this nation as his or her pitrubhu (fatherland) and punyabhu (holy land) was a Hindu. The Sikhs, the Buddhists and the Jains, in his view, met both conditions and were therefore Hindus. However, although he would concede that many Muslims and Christians living in India were true nationalists and saw the land of the Sapta Sindhus as their fatherland, their holy land lay elsewhere, in Arabia or Palestine.\n\nDid that mean they were excluded altogether from a nation which had Hindutva as its base? \u2018Their love is divided,\u2019 believed Savarkar, and they would have no choice if they were asked to pick between their fatherland and holy land. It was \u2018natural\u2019 that they should choose the holy land, he stated, adding that he was \u2018neither condemning nor lamenting\u2019, merely being matter-of-fact. He wanted to keep the door open for them, nevertheless, for \u2018the Bohras and such other Mohammedan and Christian communities possess all the essential qualifications of Hindutva\u2019, he said, even if \u2018they do not look upon India as their holy land\u2019. The \u2018patriotic\u2019 Bohra or Khoja, he argued, \u2018loves our land . . . as the Fatherland\u2019, \u2018possesses\u2019, in certain cases, \u2018pure Hindu blood\u2019, particularly \u2018if he is the first convert to Mohammedanism\u2019, is \u2018an intelligent and reasonable man, loves our history and our heroes\u2019, and \u2018in fact the Bohras and Khojas as a community worship as heroes our great ten Avatars, only adding Mohammad as the eleventh\u2019. Most of them thus shared with Hindus a common race; after all, their forefathers had been forcibly converted, according to Savarkar. He urged such \u2018long lost kith and kin\u2019, \u2018so cruelly snatched away at the point of the sword\u2019, to come back to the fold, and told them that their brothers and sisters \u2018with arms extended are standing at the open gate to welcome you\u2019. There was nowhere else they would find greater freedom of worship as in the land \u2018where a Charvak could praise atheism from the steps of the temple of Mahakal\u2019, he said. If only they recognized \u2018our common Mother\u2019 not only as their fatherland but their holy land, they would be \u2018most welcome to the Hindu fold\u2019, he stated.\n\nNo one need have any misgivings, for \u2018we are trying our best\u2019 to \u2018develop the consciousness\u2019 and \u2018attachment to the greater whole\u2019 so that \u2018Hindus, Mohammedans, Parsis, Christians and Jews would feel as Indians first, and every other thing afterwards\u2019, he said, perhaps by way of reassurance.\n\nThe goings-on in the Cellular Jail no doubt played a role in Savarkar veering rightward and embracing Hindu nationalism, and some commentators have gone to the extent of doubting if the incident of the assault on the village mosque in Bhagur was a later invention of his \u2013 he wrote his childhood reminiscences after the Hindutva text \u2013 just to make the point that his credentials had always been sufficiently pro-Hindutva.\n\nExcerpted from\u00a0**Savarkar - The True Story of the Father of Hindutva** by Vaibhav Purandare.",

Leonid Shebarshin, the main resident, was hurriedly recalled to Moscow for consultations. As well as fearing the political consequence of Mrs. Gandhi\u2019s defeat, the Centre was also embarrassed by the way the election demonstrated to the Soviet leadership the limitations of its much-vaunted active-measures campaigns and its supposed ability to manipulate Indian politics. The FCD report on its intelligence failure was largely an exercise in self-justification. It stressed that an election victory by Mrs. Gandhi had also been widely predicted by both Western and Indian observers (including the Indian intelligence community), many of whom had made even greater errors than itself. The report went on to explain the FCD's own mistakes by claiming that the extreme diversity of the huge Indian electorate and the many divisions along family, caste, ethnic, religious, class and party lines made accurate prediction of voting behavior almost impossible. This was plainly special pleading. The Complexities of Indian politics could not provide a credible explanation for the failure by the KGB (and other observers) to comprehend the collapse of support for Mrs. Gandhi in the entire Hindi belt, the traditional Congress stronghold, where it won only two seats, and its reduction to a regional party of South India, where it remained in control.\n\nThe FCD also argued, in its own defense, that Mrs. Gandhi's previous determination to hold on to power had made it reasonable to expect that she would refuse to surrender it in March 1977, and would be prepared if necessary either to fix the election results or to declare them null and void (as, it alleged, Sanjay's cronies were urging). Indeed the FCD claimed that on 20 March, when the results were announced, Mrs. Gandhi had tried to prevent the Janata Party taking power but had been insufficiently decisive and failed to get the backing of the army high command. There was no substance to these claims, which probably originated in the Delhi rumour mill, then working overtime, and were passed on to the KGB by its large network of agents and confidential contacts. Contrary to reports to Moscow from the New Delhi main residency, the transfer of power after the election was swift and orderly. In the early hours of 21 March Mrs. Gandhi summoned a short and perfunctory cabinet meeting, where she read out her letter of resignation, which was approved by the cabinet with only minor changes. At 4 am, she was driven to the home of the acting President, B.D. Jatti, and submitted her resignation. Jatti was so taken aback that, until prompted by Dhar, he forgot to ask Mrs. Gandhi to stay on as acting Prime Minister until the formation of the next government.\n\nThe tone of the Soviet media changed immediately after the Indian election. It blamed the defeat of Mrs. Gandhi, hitherto virtually free from public criticism, on 'mistakes and excesses\u2019 by her government. Seeking to exempt the CPI from blame, a commentator in Izvestia claimed, 'It is indicative that Congress Party candidates were most successful in places where a pre-election arrangement existed between the Congress and the Communist Party of India, or where the Communist Party, with no official encouragement, actively supported progressive candidates of the Congress Party\u2019. In reality the election was a disaster for the CPI as well as for Congress. Dragged down by the unpopularity of the Indira Gandhi regime, it lost all but seven of the twenty-five seats it had won in 1971, while its rival, the breakaway Communist Party of India, Marxist (CPM), won twenty-two. The Centre responded cautiously to the landslide victory of a CPM-led coalition in state elections in West Bengal in June 1977. Though Andropov was eager to set up covert communications with the new state government, he was anxious not to offend the CPI. It was therefore agreed after discussions between Shebarshin (recently promoted to become deputy head of the FCD Seventeenth Department) and a senior CPSU official that, though KGB officers could make contact with CPM leaders, they must claim to be doing so on a purely personal basis. According to FCD files, 'important information' about CPM policy was obtained by the Delhi main residency from its contacts with Party leaders. \n\nThe KGB's main priority during the early months of the Janata government was damage limitation. In the course of the campaign Morarji Desai had charged Mrs. Gandhi with doing 'whatever the Soviet Union does' and declared that, under a Janata government, the Indo-Soviet treaty might 'automatically go'. The Centre feared 'a reinforcement of reactionary anti-Soviet forces'. On 24 March the Politburo approved an FCD directive 'On measures in connection with the results of the parliamentary elections in India, whose main objectives were to preserve the Friendship Treaty and to deter Janata from seeking a rapprochement with the United States and China. Though the Desai government did set out to improve relations with the United States and China, the Indo-Soviet treaty survived. A joint communiqu\u00e9 after a visit by Gromyko to New Delhi in April committed both countries to \u2018the further strengthening of equal and mutually beneficial co-operation in the spirit of the Indo-Soviet Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Co-operation'. In August the Politburo approved a directive on KGB active measures entitled 'On measures to influence the ruling circles of India in new conditions to the advantage of the USSR'.\n\nThe 'new conditions' of Janata rule made active-measures campaigns more difficult than before. Articles planted by the KGB in the Indian press declined sharply from 1,980 in 1976 to 411 in 1977. The Centre, however, continued to make exaggerated claims for the success of its active measures in making the Janata government suspicious of American and Chinese policy. The New Delhi main residency also claimed in June 1978 that it had succeeded in discrediting the Home Minister, Charan Singh, Indira Gandhi's most outspoken opponent in the Janata government, and forcing his dismissal. In reality, Singh's dismissal was due to the fact that he had accused Desai and other ministers of being 'a collection of impotent men' because of their failure to bring Mrs. Gandhi to trial. He was later to return to the government and briefly succeeded Desai as Prime Minister in the later months of 1979.\n\nThe March 1977 KGB directive approved by the Politburo had instructed the Delhi main residency to 'influence Mrs. Gandhi to renew the Indian National Congress on a democratic \\[left-wing\\] basis'. In order not to offend the Janata government, the Soviet embassy was wary of maintaining official contact with Mrs. Gandhi after her election defeat. Instead, the Delhi main residency re-established covert contact with her through an operations officer, Viktor Nikolayevich Cherepakhin (codenamed VLADLEN), operating under cover as a Trud correspondent, though there is no evidence that she realized he was from the KGB. The residency also set up an active-measures fund codenamed DEPO in an attempt to buy influence within the Committee for Democratic Action founded by Mrs. Gandhi and some of her supporters in May 1977. Though there is no evidence that Mrs. Gandhi knew of its existence, the fund had available in July 275,000 convertible rubles. On New Year's Day 1978 Mrs. Gandhi instigated a second split in the Congress Party. She and her followers, the majority of the party, reconstituted themselves as Congress (I) - I for Indira. Though she eventually admitted that things 'did get a little out of hand' during the emergency, she continued to insist that Janata's election victory owed much to 'foreign help'. The movement against us, she declared, 'was engineered by outside forces\u2019. As usual, Mrs. Gandhi doubtless had the CIA in mind.\n\nJanata's fragile unity, which had been made possible during the 1977 election campaign only by common hostility to Indira Gandhi, failed to survive the experience of government. At the general election in January 1980 Congress (I) won 351 of the 542 seats. 'It's Indira All The Way', declared the headline in the 'Times of India'. Soon after her election victory, Mrs. Gandhi tried to renew contact with Cherepakhin, only to discover that he had been recalled to Moscow. While welcoming Mrs. Gandhi's return to power, the Centre was apprehensive about the future. The power of Sanjay whom it strongly distrusted, was at its zenith, his role as heir apparent appeared unassailable, and-despite the presence, unknown to Sanjay, of an agent codenamed PURI in his entourage-the KGB seems to have discovered no significant means of influence over him. Though Sanjay's death in an air crash in June 1980 left Mrs. Gandhi distraught, it was doubtless welcomed in the Centre.\n\nMrs. Gandhi's relations with Moscow in the early 1980s never quite recaptured the warmth of her previous term in office. She particularly resented the fact that she could no longer count on the support of the CPI. During Brezhnev's state visit to India in December 1980, she said pointedly at a reception in his honour 'Understandably, we face an onslaught from the \"right\" and, not so understandably, from the \"left\".' According to KGB reports, some of the CPI attacks were personal. Indian Communist leaders spread rumours that Mrs. Gandhi was taking bribes both from state ministers and from the French suppliers of the Mirage fighters which she decided to purchase for the Indian air force. During visits to India by both Brezhnev and the Soviet Defense Minister, Marshal Ustinov, she asked for Soviet pressure to bring the CPI into line. When the pressure failed to materialize, Mrs. Gandhi took her revenge. In May 1981 she set up a new Congress (I)-sponsored association, the Friends of the Soviet Union, as a rival to the CPl-sponsored Indo-Soviet Cultural Society-declaring that the time had come to liberate Indo-Soviet friendship from those who had set themselves up as its 'custodians'. It was, she said, the 'professional friends and foes of the Soviet Union who created problems for us'. She also set up a 'World peace and solidarity' organization to break the monopoly of the World Peace Council, headed by an Indian Communist and much used as a vehicle for Soviet active measures.\n\nMoscow's failure to bring the CPI into line however, continued to rankle with Mrs. Gandhi. In June 1983 she sent a secret letter to the Soviet leader, Yuri Andropov, attacking the CPI for having 'ganged up' against her with right-wing reactionaries. The letter was entrusted to Yogendra Sharma, a member of the Parry Politburo who disagreed with Rajeshwar Rao's opposition to Mrs. Gandhi. Once in Moscow, however Sharma had second thoughts and 'confessed all' to a Party comrade. When the story was made public in India, Indira's critics accused her of 'inviting Soviet interference in India's internal affairs'. Mrs. Gandhi refused to comment. Though somewhat tarnished, however, the Indo-Soviet special relationship survived. When Mrs. Gandhi visited Moscow for Brezhnev's funeral she was the first non-Communist leader to be received by Yuri Andropov.\n\nThe KGB continued to make large claims for the success of its active measures. When the Indian government refused in July 1981 to give an entry visa to an American diplomat named Griffin, who was due to take up a post as political counselor at the US embassy, the KGB claimed that the decision was due to its success over the previous six months in linking him with the CIA. Vladimir Kryuchkov, the head of the FCD, reported to the Politburo.\n\nAccording to information received, the initiative in making this decision came from Indira Gandhi herself, A significant role was also played by anti-American articles which we inspired in the Indian and foreign press which cited various sources to expose the dangerous nature of the CIA's subversive operations in India. Attempts by representatives of the USA and of the American press to justify the methods and to pretend that Griffin had been the victim of a Soviet 'disinformation' campaign were decisively rejected by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Narasimha Rao, who stated that this action was taken independently and was in no way prompted by another country.\n\nThe greatest successes of Soviet active measures in India remained the exploitation of the susceptibility of Indira Gandhi and her advisers to bogus CIA conspiracies against them. In March 1980 Home Minister Zail Singh blamed the USA and China for fomenting unrest in Assam and the tribal areas of the north-east. Shortly afterwards Home Ministry officials claimed to have 'definite information' that the CIA was 'pumping money' into the region through Christian missionaries. Mrs. Gandhi herself repeatedly referred to the 'foreign hand' behind this and other outbreaks of domestic unrest. Though she rarely identified the 'foreign hand' in public, it was clear that she meant the CIA.\n\nOne of the main aims of KGB active measures in the early 1980s was to manufacture evidence that the CIA and Pakistani intelligence were behind the growth of Sikh separatism in the Punjab. In the autumn of 1981 Service A launched operation KONTAKT based on a forged document purporting to contain details of the weapons and money provided by Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) to the militants seeking to bring about the creation of an independent Sikh state of Khalistan. In November the forgery was passed to a senior Indian diplomat in Islamabad. Shortly afterwards the Islamabad residency reported to the Centre that, according to (possibly optimistic) agents' reports, the level of anxiety in the Indian embassy about Pakistani support for Sikh separatists indicated that KONTAKT was having the alarmist effect that Service A had hoped for.\n\nIn the spring of 1982 the New Delhi residency reported that Agent 'S' (apparently a recent recruit) had direct access to Mrs. Gandhi and had personally presented to her another forged ISI document fabricated by Service A, which purported to demonstrate Pakistani involvement in the Khalistan conspiracy. Though there is no convincing evidence that Agent 'S' or the forgeries channeled through him had any significant influence on Mrs. Gandhi, the Centre succumbed to one of its recurrent bouts of wishful thinking about its ability to manipulate Indian policy. On 5 May it congratulated the recently installed main resident, Aleksandr losifovich Lysenko (codenamed BOGDAN), on the supposed success of Agent 'S' and informed him that the Centre proposed to use 'S' as a major channel for feeding future disinformation to Mrs. Gandhi. Before the agent's meeting with Mrs. Gandhi, the Centre sent the following detailed instructions:\n\n(A) During meetings \\[with 'S'\\], acquaint the agent with the contents of the \\[latest forged\\] document and show interest in his opinion regarding the importance and relevance of the information contained in it for the Indian authorities. Also it should be explained to the agent that the document is genuine, obtained by us through secret channels.\n\n(B) Work out a detailed story of how 'S' obtained the document. (This will involve organizing a short trip to Pakistan for the agent)\n\n(C) Inform 'S' that, in accordance with the terms laid down by the source \\[of the document\\] he must not leave the document with VANO \\[Mrs. Gandhi\\]. Recommend to the agent that he acts in the following way in order not to arouse a negative reaction in VANO. If VANO insists that the document is left with her, then 'S' should leave a previously prepared copy of the document, without the headings which would indicate its origin. Instruct 'S' to observe VANO\u2019s reaction to the document.  \n(D) Point out to the agent that it is essential that he builds on his conversation with VANO in order that he can drop hints on what she can expect from 'S\u2019 in the future and what information would be of special interest to her.\n\n'S' reported that he had shown the document to Mrs. Gandhi on May 1982. The fact that she did not ask for a copy suggests that she did not attach much significance to it. The KGB, however, preferred to credit the self-serving claims made by 'S' about his supposed influence on the Prime Minister.\n\nShortly after succeeding Brezhnev as Soviet leader in November 1982 Yuri Andropov approved a proposal by Kryuchkov to fabricate a further Pakistani intelligence document detailing ISI plans to ferment religious disturbances in Punjab and promote the creation of Khalistan as an independent Sikh state. The Centre believed that the Indian ambassador in Pakistan, to whom this forgery was sent, would consider it so important that he was bound to forward it to Mrs. Gandhi. The KGB appeared by now supremely confident that it could continue to deceive her indefinitely with fabricated reports of CIA and Pakistani conspiracies against her.\n\nMrs. Gandhi's importance as one of the Third World's most influential leaders was further enhanced, in Moscow's eyes, by her election as Chair of the Non-Aligned Movement in succession to Fidel Castro. The Indian press published photographs of a beaming Castro embracing her in a bear hug as he handed over to her in March 1983 at the seventh summit of the Movement in Delhi. On the eve of the summit the Delhi main residency succeeded in planting in the Indian press a forged secret memorandum in the name of the US representa\u00active at the United Nations, Jeane Kirkpatrick, which gave further bogus details of American plans to foster divisions in the Third World and undermine Indian influence. Under Mrs. Gandhi\u2019s chairmanship, the Non-Aligned summit devoted little time to the war in Afghanistan and concentrated instead on issues of disarmament and economic development, which offered ample scope for attacks on the United States. The post-summit communiqu\u00e9 condemned the United States fifteen times; the Soviet Union, by contrast, was only once bracketed with the United States as sharing responsibility for the arms race. Moscow was predictably delighted. Pravda declared that 'the Non-Aligned Movement has displayed devotion to its basic principles of struggle against imperialism, colonialism, racism and war\u2019.\n\nThe next stage in the Soviet cultivation of the Gandhi dynasty was the visit to Moscow in July 1983 by Indira's elder son, Rajiv, who had reluctantly entered politics at his mother's insistence after Sanjay's death and was being groomed by her for the succession. The high-level meetings and glittering receptions laid on for Rajiv showed, according to one Indian observer, that he had been 'virtually anointed by the Soviet commissars as the unquestioned successor to Mrs. Gandhi'. During his visit Rajiv was plainly persuaded by his hosts that the CIA was engaged in serious subversion in the Punjab, where Sikh separatism now posed the most serious challenge to Congress government. He declared on his return that there was 'definite interference from the USA in the Punjab situation'.\n\nIn early June 1984 Mrs. Gandhi sent troops into the Punjab where they stormed the Sikh holy of holies, the Golden Temple at Amritsar. The Soviet Union, like the CPI, quickly expressed 'full understanding of the steps taken by the Indian government to curb terrorism'. Once again, Mrs. Gandhi took seriously Soviet claims of secret CIA support for the Sikhs. A KGB active measure also fabricated evidence that Pakistani intelligence was planning to recruit Afghan refugees to assassinate her. Though Mrs. Gandhi, thanks largely to the KGB, exaggerated the threat from the United States and Pakistan, she tragically underestimated the threat from the Sikhs in her own bodyguard, countermanding as a matter of principle an order from the head of the IB that they be transferred to other duties. India, she bravely insisted, 'was secular'. One of the principles by which she had lived was soon to cost her, her life. On 31 October she was shot dead by two Sikh guards in the garden of her house. Predictably, some conspiracy theorists were later to argue that the guards had been working for the CIA. Though the Centre probably did not originate this conspiracy theory, attempting to implicate the Agency in the assassination of Mrs. Gandhi became one of the chief priorities of KGB active measures in India over the next few years.\n\nRajiv Gandhi's first foreign visit after succeeding his mother as Prime Minister was to the Soviet Union for the funeral of Konstantin Chernenko in March 1985. He and Chernenko's successor, Mikhail Gorbachev, established an immediate rapport, which was reinforced during Rajiv's first official visit two months later. The KGB, meanwhile, pursued active-measures operations designed to persuade Rajiv that the CIA was plotting against him. Its fabrications, however, which included a forged letter in 1987 from the DCI, William Casey, on plans for his overthrow, seem to have had little effect. The personal friendship between Rajiv and Gorbachev could not disguise the declining importance of the Indian special relationship for the Soviet Union. Part of Gorbachev's 'new thinking' in foreign policy was the attempt to extricate the Soviet Union from India's disputes with China and Pakistan. At a press conference during his visit to India in November 1986, Gorbachev was much more equivocal than his predecessors about Soviet support in a military conflict between India and China. The winding down of the cold war also greatly decreased the usefulness of India as an arena for KGB active measures. One of the most successful active measures during Gorbachev's first two years in power was the attempt to blame Aids on American biological warfare. The story originated on US Independence Day 1984 in an article published in the Indian newspaper Patriot, alleging that the Aids virus had been 'manufactured' during genetic engineering experiments at Fort Derrick, Maryland. In the first six months of 1987 alone the story received major media coverage in over forty Third World countries. Faced with American protests and the denunciation of the story by the international scientific community, however, Gorbachev and his advisers were clearly concerned that exposure of Soviet disinformation might damage the new Soviet image in the West. In August 1987 US officials were told in Moscow that the Aids story was officially disowned. Soviet press coverage of the story came to an almost complete halt. In the era of glasnost, Moscow also regarded the front organizations as a rapidly declining asset. In 1986 Romesh Chandra, the Indian Communist President of the most important of them, the World Peace Council, felt obliged to indulge in self-criticism. 'The criticisms made of the President's work', he acknowledged, 'require to be heeded and necessary corrections made.' The main 'correction' which followed was his own replacement.\n\nRajiv Gandhi lost power in India at elections late in 1989 just as the Soviet bloc was beginning to disintegrate. New Delhi was wrong-footed by the final collapse of the Soviet Union two years later. On the outbreak of the hard-line coup in Moscow of August 1991 which attempted to overthrow Gorbachev, Prime Minister Narasimha Rao declared that it might serve as a warning to those who attempted change too rapidly. Following the collapse of the coup a few days later, Rao's statement was held against him by both Gorbachev and Yeltsin. When Gorbachev rang world leaders after his release from house arrest in the Crimea, he made no attempt to contact Rao. The Indian ambassador did not attend the briefing given by Yeltsin to senior members of the Moscow diplomatic corps after the coup collapsed. The Indo-Soviet special relationship, to which the KGB had devoted so much of its energies for most of the Cold War, was at an end.",

Leonid Shebarshin, the main resident, was hurriedly recalled to Moscow for consultations. As well as fearing the political consequence of Mrs. Gandhi\u2019s defeat, the Centre was also embarrassed by the way the election demonstrated to the Soviet leadership the limitations of its much-vaunted active-measures campaigns and its supposed ability to manipulate Indian politics. The FCD report on its intelligence failure was largely an exercise in self-justification. It stressed that an election victory by Mrs. Gandhi had also been widely predicted by both Western and Indian observers (including the Indian intelligence community), many of whom had made even greater errors than itself. The report went on to explain the FCD&amp;#39;s own mistakes by claiming that the extreme diversity of the huge Indian electorate and the many divisions along family, caste, ethnic, religious, class and party lines made accurate prediction of voting behavior almost impossible. This was plainly special pleading. The Complexities of Indian politics could not provide a credible explanation for the failure by the KGB (and other observers) to comprehend the collapse of support for Mrs. Gandhi in the entire Hindi belt, the traditional Congress stronghold, where it won only two seats, and its reduction to a regional party of South India, where it remained in control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The FCD also argued, in its own defense, that Mrs. Gandhi&amp;#39;s previous determination to hold on to power had made it reasonable to expect that she would refuse to surrender it in March 1977, and would be prepared if necessary either to fix the election results or to declare them null and void (as, it alleged, Sanjay&amp;#39;s cronies were urging). Indeed the FCD claimed that on 20 March, when the results were announced, Mrs. Gandhi had tried to prevent the Janata Party taking power but had been insufficiently decisive and failed to get the backing of the army high command. There was no substance to these claims, which probably originated in the Delhi rumour mill, then working overtime, and were passed on to the KGB by its large network of agents and confidential contacts. Contrary to reports to Moscow from the New Delhi main residency, the transfer of power after the election was swift and orderly. In the early hours of 21 March Mrs. Gandhi summoned a short and perfunctory cabinet meeting, where she read out her letter of resignation, which was approved by the cabinet with only minor changes. At 4 am, she was driven to the home of the acting President, B.D. Jatti, and submitted her resignation. Jatti was so taken aback that, until prompted by Dhar, he forgot to ask Mrs. Gandhi to stay on as acting Prime Minister until the formation of the next government.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tone of the Soviet media changed immediately after the Indian election. It blamed the defeat of Mrs. Gandhi, hitherto virtually free from public criticism, on &amp;#39;mistakes and excesses\u2019 by her government. Seeking to exempt the CPI from blame, a commentator in Izvestia claimed, &amp;#39;It is indicative that Congress Party candidates were most successful in places where a pre-election arrangement existed between the Congress and the Communist Party of India, or where the Communist Party, with no official encouragement, actively supported progressive candidates of the Congress Party\u2019. In reality the election was a disaster for the CPI as well as for Congress. Dragged down by the unpopularity of the Indira Gandhi regime, it lost all but seven of the twenty-five seats it had won in 1971, while its rival, the breakaway Communist Party of India, Marxist (CPM), won twenty-two. The Centre responded cautiously to the landslide victory of a CPM-led coalition in state elections in West Bengal in June 1977. Though Andropov was eager to set up covert communications with the new state government, he was anxious not to offend the CPI. It was therefore agreed after discussions between Shebarshin (recently promoted to become deputy head of the FCD Seventeenth Department) and a senior CPSU official that, though KGB officers could make contact with CPM leaders, they must claim to be doing so on a purely personal basis. According to FCD files, &amp;#39;important information&amp;#39; about CPM policy was obtained by the Delhi main residency from its contacts with Party leaders. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The KGB&amp;#39;s main priority during the early months of the Janata government was damage limitation. In the course of the campaign Morarji Desai had charged Mrs. Gandhi with doing &amp;#39;whatever the Soviet Union does&amp;#39; and declared that, under a Janata government, the Indo-Soviet treaty might &amp;#39;automatically go&amp;#39;. The Centre feared &amp;#39;a reinforcement of reactionary anti-Soviet forces&amp;#39;. On 24 March the Politburo approved an FCD directive &amp;#39;On measures in connection with the results of the parliamentary elections in India, whose main objectives were to preserve the Friendship Treaty and to deter Janata from seeking a rapprochement with the United States and China. Though the Desai government did set out to improve relations with the United States and China, the Indo-Soviet treaty survived. A joint communiqu\u00e9 after a visit by Gromyko to New Delhi in April committed both countries to \u2018the further strengthening of equal and mutually beneficial co-operation in the spirit of the Indo-Soviet Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Co-operation&amp;#39;. In August the Politburo approved a directive on KGB active measures entitled &amp;#39;On measures to influence the ruling circles of India in new conditions to the advantage of the USSR&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;#39;new conditions&amp;#39; of Janata rule made active-measures campaigns more difficult than before. Articles planted by the KGB in the Indian press declined sharply from 1,980 in 1976 to 411 in 1977. The Centre, however, continued to make exaggerated claims for the success of its active measures in making the Janata government suspicious of American and Chinese policy. The New Delhi main residency also claimed in June 1978 that it had succeeded in discrediting the Home Minister, Charan Singh, Indira Gandhi&amp;#39;s most outspoken opponent in the Janata government, and forcing his dismissal. In reality, Singh&amp;#39;s dismissal was due to the fact that he had accused Desai and other ministers of being &amp;#39;a collection of impotent men&amp;#39; because of their failure to bring Mrs. Gandhi to trial. He was later to return to the government and briefly succeeded Desai as Prime Minister in the later months of 1979.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The March 1977 KGB directive approved by the Politburo had instructed the Delhi main residency to &amp;#39;influence Mrs. Gandhi to renew the Indian National Congress on a democratic [left-wing] basis&amp;#39;. In order not to offend the Janata government, the Soviet embassy was wary of maintaining official contact with Mrs. Gandhi after her election defeat. Instead, the Delhi main residency re-established covert contact with her through an operations officer, Viktor Nikolayevich Cherepakhin (codenamed VLADLEN), operating under cover as a Trud correspondent, though there is no evidence that she realized he was from the KGB. The residency also set up an active-measures fund codenamed DEPO in an attempt to buy influence within the Committee for Democratic Action founded by Mrs. Gandhi and some of her supporters in May 1977. Though there is no evidence that Mrs. Gandhi knew of its existence, the fund had available in July 275,000 convertible rubles. On New Year&amp;#39;s Day 1978 Mrs. Gandhi instigated a second split in the Congress Party. She and her followers, the majority of the party, reconstituted themselves as Congress (I) - I for Indira. Though she eventually admitted that things &amp;#39;did get a little out of hand&amp;#39; during the emergency, she continued to insist that Janata&amp;#39;s election victory owed much to &amp;#39;foreign help&amp;#39;. The movement against us, she declared, &amp;#39;was engineered by outside forces\u2019. As usual, Mrs. Gandhi doubtless had the CIA in mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Janata&amp;#39;s fragile unity, which had been made possible during the 1977 election campaign only by common hostility to Indira Gandhi, failed to survive the experience of government. At the general election in January 1980 Congress (I) won 351 of the 542 seats. &amp;#39;It&amp;#39;s Indira All The Way&amp;#39;, declared the headline in the &amp;#39;Times of India&amp;#39;. Soon after her election victory, Mrs. Gandhi tried to renew contact with Cherepakhin, only to discover that he had been recalled to Moscow. While welcoming Mrs. Gandhi&amp;#39;s return to power, the Centre was apprehensive about the future. The power of Sanjay whom it strongly distrusted, was at its zenith, his role as heir apparent appeared unassailable, and-despite the presence, unknown to Sanjay, of an agent codenamed PURI in his entourage-the KGB seems to have discovered no significant means of influence over him. Though Sanjay&amp;#39;s death in an air crash in June 1980 left Mrs. Gandhi distraught, it was doubtless welcomed in the Centre.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Gandhi&amp;#39;s relations with Moscow in the early 1980s never quite recaptured the warmth of her previous term in office. She particularly resented the fact that she could no longer count on the support of the CPI. During Brezhnev&amp;#39;s state visit to India in December 1980, she said pointedly at a reception in his honour &amp;#39;Understandably, we face an onslaught from the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; and, not so understandably, from the &amp;quot;left&amp;quot;.&amp;#39; According to KGB reports, some of the CPI attacks were personal. Indian Communist leaders spread rumours that Mrs. Gandhi was taking bribes both from state ministers and from the French suppliers of the Mirage fighters which she decided to purchase for the Indian air force. During visits to India by both Brezhnev and the Soviet Defense Minister, Marshal Ustinov, she asked for Soviet pressure to bring the CPI into line. When the pressure failed to materialize, Mrs. Gandhi took her revenge. In May 1981 she set up a new Congress (I)-sponsored association, the Friends of the Soviet Union, as a rival to the CPl-sponsored Indo-Soviet Cultural Society-declaring that the time had come to liberate Indo-Soviet friendship from those who had set themselves up as its &amp;#39;custodians&amp;#39;. It was, she said, the &amp;#39;professional friends and foes of the Soviet Union who created problems for us&amp;#39;. She also set up a &amp;#39;World peace and solidarity&amp;#39; organization to break the monopoly of the World Peace Council, headed by an Indian Communist and much used as a vehicle for Soviet active measures.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moscow&amp;#39;s failure to bring the CPI into line however, continued to rankle with Mrs. Gandhi. In June 1983 she sent a secret letter to the Soviet leader, Yuri Andropov, attacking the CPI for having &amp;#39;ganged up&amp;#39; against her with right-wing reactionaries. The letter was entrusted to Yogendra Sharma, a member of the Parry Politburo who disagreed with Rajeshwar Rao&amp;#39;s opposition to Mrs. Gandhi. Once in Moscow, however Sharma had second thoughts and &amp;#39;confessed all&amp;#39; to a Party comrade. When the story was made public in India, Indira&amp;#39;s critics accused her of &amp;#39;inviting Soviet interference in India&amp;#39;s internal affairs&amp;#39;. Mrs. Gandhi refused to comment. Though somewhat tarnished, however, the Indo-Soviet special relationship survived. When Mrs. Gandhi visited Moscow for Brezhnev&amp;#39;s funeral she was the first non-Communist leader to be received by Yuri Andropov.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The KGB continued to make large claims for the success of its active measures. When the Indian government refused in July 1981 to give an entry visa to an American diplomat named Griffin, who was due to take up a post as political counselor at the US embassy, the KGB claimed that the decision was due to its success over the previous six months in linking him with the CIA. Vladimir Kryuchkov, the head of the FCD, reported to the Politburo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to information received, the initiative in making this decision came from Indira Gandhi herself, A significant role was also played by anti-American articles which we inspired in the Indian and foreign press which cited various sources to expose the dangerous nature of the CIA&amp;#39;s subversive operations in India.

The Soviet Union, like the CPI, quickly expressed &amp;#39;full understanding of the steps taken by the Indian government to curb terrorism&amp;#39;. Once again, Mrs. Gandhi took seriously Soviet claims of secret CIA support for the Sikhs. A KGB active measure also fabricated evidence that Pakistani intelligence was planning to recruit Afghan refugees to assassinate her. Though Mrs. Gandhi, thanks largely to the KGB, exaggerated the threat from the United States and Pakistan, she tragically underestimated the threat from the Sikhs in her own bodyguard, countermanding as a matter of principle an order from the head of the IB that they be transferred to other duties. India, she bravely insisted, &amp;#39;was secular&amp;#39;. One of the principles by which she had lived was soon to cost her, her life. On 31 October she was shot dead by two Sikh guards in the garden of her house. Predictably, some conspiracy theorists were later to argue that the guards had been working for the CIA. Though the Centre probably did not originate this conspiracy theory, attempting to implicate the Agency in the assassination of Mrs. Gandhi became one of the chief priorities of KGB active measures in India over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rajiv Gandhi&amp;#39;s first foreign visit after succeeding his mother as Prime Minister was to the Soviet Union for the funeral of Konstantin Chernenko in March 1985. He and Chernenko&amp;#39;s successor, Mikhail Gorbachev, established an immediate rapport, which was reinforced during Rajiv&amp;#39;s first official visit two months later. The KGB, meanwhile, pursued active-measures operations designed to persuade Rajiv that the CIA was plotting against him. Its fabrications, however, which included a forged letter in 1987 from the DCI, William Casey, on plans for his overthrow, seem to have had little effect. The personal friendship between Rajiv and Gorbachev could not disguise the declining importance of the Indian special relationship for the Soviet Union. Part of Gorbachev&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;new thinking&amp;#39; in foreign policy was the attempt to extricate the Soviet Union from India&amp;#39;s disputes with China and Pakistan. At a press conference during his visit to India in November 1986, Gorbachev was much more equivocal than his predecessors about Soviet support in a military conflict between India and China. The winding down of the cold war also greatly decreased the usefulness of India as an arena for KGB active measures. One of the most successful active measures during Gorbachev&amp;#39;s first two years in power was the attempt to blame Aids on American biological warfare. The story originated on US Independence Day 1984 in an article published in the Indian newspaper Patriot, alleging that the Aids virus had been &amp;#39;manufactured&amp;#39; during genetic engineering experiments at Fort Derrick, Maryland. In the first six months of 1987 alone the story received major media coverage in over forty Third World countries. Faced with American protests and the denunciation of the story by the international scientific community, however, Gorbachev and his advisers were clearly concerned that exposure of Soviet disinformation might damage the new Soviet image in the West. In August 1987 US officials were told in Moscow that the Aids story was officially disowned. Soviet press coverage of the story came to an almost complete halt. In the era of glasnost, Moscow also regarded the front organizations as a rapidly declining asset. In 1986 Romesh Chandra, the Indian Communist President of the most important of them, the World Peace Council, felt obliged to indulge in self-criticism. &amp;#39;The criticisms made of the President&amp;#39;s work&amp;#39;, he acknowledged, &amp;#39;require to be heeded and necessary corrections made.&amp;#39; The main &amp;#39;correction&amp;#39; which followed was his own replacement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rajiv Gandhi lost power in India at elections late in 1989 just as the Soviet bloc was beginning to disintegrate. New Delhi was wrong-footed by the final collapse of the Soviet Union two years later. On the outbreak of the hard-line coup in Moscow of August 1991 which attempted to overthrow Gorbachev, Prime Minister Narasimha Rao declared that it might serve as a warning to those who attempted change too rapidly. Following the collapse of the coup a few days later, Rao&amp;#39;s statement was held against him by both Gorbachev and Yeltsin. When Gorbachev rang world leaders after his release from house arrest in the Crimea, he made no attempt to contact Rao. The Indian ambassador did not attend the briefing given by Yeltsin to senior members of the Moscow diplomatic corps after the coup collapsed. The Indo-Soviet special relationship, to which the KGB had devoted so much of its energies for most of the Cold War, was at an end.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

     "selftext": "What is The Mitrokhin Archive?\n\nThe \"Mitrokhin Archive\" is a collection of handwritten notes made secretly by KGB archivist Vasili Mitrokhin during his thirty years as a KGB archivist in the foreign intelligence service and the First Chief Directorate. When he defected to the United Kingdom in 1992 he brought the archive with him.\n[The Mitrokhin Archive Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitrokhin_Archive)\n\nA chapter from the book 'The Mitrokhin Archive II: The KGB and the World' shows that Indira Gandhi was on the payroll of KGB. The whole nation was on the payroll of KGB and even ISI. Indira was put in place by murdering Lal Bahadur Shastri, the second PM of India, by the KGB.\n\n# The Special Relationship With India\n\n**Part 1: The supremacy of the Indian National Congress**\n\nThe Third World country on which the KGB eventually concentrated most operational effort during the Cold War was India. Under Stalin, however, India had been regarded as an imperialist puppet. The Great Soviet Encyclopedia dismissed Mohandas 'Mahatma' Gandhi, who led India to independence in 1947, as 'a reactionary\u2026. who betrayed the people and helped the imperialists against them; aped the ascetics; pretended in a demagogic way to be a supporter of Indian independence and an enemy of the British; and widely exploited religious prejudice'. Despite his distaste for Stalinist attacks Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of independent India, 'had no doubt that the Soviet revolution had advanced human society by a great leap and had lit a bright flame which could not be smothered'. Though later eulogized by Soviet writers as \u2018a leader of international magnitude who ranked 'among the best minds of the twentieth century', Nehru was well aware that until Stalin's death in 1953 he, like Gandhi, was regarded as a reactionary. During the early years of Indian independence, secret correspondence from Moscow to the Communist Party of India (CPI) was frequently intercepted by the Intelligence Branch (IB) in New Delhi (as it had been when the IB was working for the British Raj). According to the head of the IB, B. N. Mullik, until the early 1950s 'every instruction that had issued from Moscow had expressed the necessity and importance \\[for\\] the Indian Communist Party to overthrow the \"reactionary\" Nehru Government'. Early in 1951 Mullik gave Nehru a copy of the latest exhortations from Moscow to the CPI, which contained a warning that they must not fall into government hands. Nehru 'laughed out loud and remarked that Moscow apparently did not know how smart our Intelligence was'.\n\nNeither Nehru nor the IB, however, realized how thoroughly the Indian embassy in Moscow was being penetrated by the KGB, using its usual varieties of the honey trap. The Indian diplomat PROKHOR (code name given for the Indian by KGB) was recruited, probably in the early 1950s, with the help of a female swallow (a female Russian prostitute/spy), codenamed NEVEROVA, who presumably seduced him. The KGB was clearly pleased with the material which PROKHOR provided, which included on two occasions the embassy code-book and deciphering tables, since in 1954 it increased his monthly payments from 1,000 to 4,000 rupees. Another Indian diplomat, RADAR, was recruited in 1956, also with the assistance of a swallow, who on this occasion claimed (probably falsely) to be pregnant. A third KGB swallow persuaded a cipher clerk in the Indian embassy, ARTUR, to go heavily into debt in order to make it easier to compromise him. He was recruited as an agent in 1957 after being trapped (probably into illegal currency dealing) by a KGB officer posing as a black-marketeer. As a result of these and other penetrations of the embassy, Soviet code breakers were probably able to decrypt substantial numbers of Indian diplomatic communications.\n\nAs KGB operations in India expanded during the 1950s and 1960s, the Centre seems to have discovered the extent of the IB's previous penetration of the CPI. According to a KGB report, an investigation into Promode Das Gupta, who became secretary of the Bengal Communist Party in 1959, concluded that he had been recruited by the IB in 1947. Further significant IB penetrations were discovered in the Kerala and Madras parties. By the 1960s KGB penetration of the Indian intelligence community and other parts of its official bureaucracy had enabled it to turn the tables on the IB. After the KGB became the main conduit for both money and secret communications from Moscow, high-level IB penetration of the CPI (Communist Party of India) became much more difficult. As in other Communist parties, this secret channel was known only to a small inner circle within the leadership. In 1959 the CPI General Secretary, Ajoy Ghosh, agreed With the Delhi residency on plans to fund an import-export business for trade with the Soviet bloc, headed by a senior Party member codenamed DED, whose profits would be creamed off for \"party funds\u201d. Within little more than a decade its annual profits had grown to over 3 million rupees. The Soviet news agency Novosti provided further subsidies by routinely paying the CPI publishing House at a rate 50 percent above its normal charges.\n\nMoscow's interest in Nehru was greatly enhanced by his emergence (together with Nasser and Tito) as one of the leaders of the Non-Aligned Movement, which began to take shape at the Bandung Conference in 1955, An exchange of official visits in the same year by Nehru and Khrushchev opened a new era in Indo-Soviet relations. On his return from India in December, Khrushchev reported to the Presidium that he had received a warm welcome, but criticized the 'primitive' portrayal of India in Soviet publications and films which demonstrated a poor grasp of Indian culture. Khrushchev was, however, clearly pleased with the intelligence and personal security provided by the KGB during his trip and proposed that the officers concerned be decorated and considered for salary increases American reliance on Pakistan as a strategic counterweight to Soviet influence in Asia encouraged India to turn to the USSR. In 1956 Nehru declared that he had never encountered a 'grosser case of naked aggression' than the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt, but failed to condemn the brutal Soviet suppression of the Hungarian Uprising in the same year. India voted against a UN resolution calling for free elections in Hungary and the withdrawal of Soviet forces. The Kremlin increasingly valued Indian support as, with growing frequency, the Non-Aligned Movement tended to vote in the UN with the Soviet bloc rather than the West. During the 1960s India and the Soviet Union found further common cause against Mao's China.\n\nWithin Nehru's Congress Party government the KGB set out to cultivate its leading left-wing firebrand and Nehru's close adviser, Krishna Menon, who became Minister of Defense in 1957 after spending most of the previous decade as, successively, Indian High Commissioner in London and representative at the United Nations. To the Soviet Foreign Minister, Andrei Gromyko, 'It was\u2026\u2026. plain that \\[Menon\\] was personally friendly to the Soviet Union. He would say to me heatedly: \"You cannot imagine the hatred the Indian people felt and stiff feel to the colonialists, the British\u2026\u2026 The methods used by American capital to exploit the backward countries may be oblique, but they're just as harsh.\"\n\nIn May 1962 the Soviet Presidium (which under Khrushchev replaced the Politburo) authorized the KGB residency in New Delhi to conduct active-measures operations designed to strengthen Menon's position in India and enhance his personal popularity, probably in the hope that he would become Nehru's successor. During Menon's tenure of the Defense Ministry, India's main source of arms imports switched from the West to the Soviet Union. The Indian decision in the summer of 1962 to purchase MiG-21s rather than British Lightnings was due chiefly to Menon. The British High Commissioner in New Delhi reported to London, \u201cKrishna Menon has from the beginning managed to surround this question with almost conspiratorial official and ministerial secrecy combined with a skillful putting about of stories in favour of the MiG and against Western aircraft\u201d. Menon's career, however, was disrupted by the Chinese invasion of India in October 1961. Having failed to take the prospect of invasion seriously until the eve of the attack, Menon found himself made the scapegoat for India's unpreparedness. Following the rout of Indian forces by the Chinese, Nehru reluctantly dismissed him on 31 October. A fortnight later, the Presidium authorized active measures by the Delhi residency, including secret finance for a newspaper which supported Menon, in a forlorn attempt to resuscitate his political career. Though similar active measures by the KGB in Menon's favour before the 1967 election also had little observable effect, a secret message to Menon from the CPSU Central Committee (probably sent by its International Department) expressed appreciation for his positive attitude to the Soviet Union.\n\nKGB support did little to revive Menon's fortunes. Before he became Defense Minister, most of his political career had been spent outside India, including twenty eight years in Britain, where he had served for more than a decade as a Labour councilor in London. As a result, despite the personal support of some ardent disciples within the Congress Party (at least one of whom received substantial KGB funding) Menon lacked any real popular following in India itself. By the time he returned to India from foreign exiles the only language he spoke was English, he could no longer tolerate spicy Indian food and he preferred a tweed jacket and flannel trousers to traditional Indian dress. After failing to be denominated by Congress in his existing Bombay constituency for the 1967 election, Menon stood unsuccessfully as an independent. Two years later, with Communist support, he was elected as an independent in West Bengal. Some of the issues on which he campaigned suggest that he had been influenced by KGB active measures-as, for example, in his demand that American troops in Vietnam be tried for genocide and his claim that they were slitting open the wombs of pregnant women to expose their unborn babies. Well before his death in 1974, however, Menon had ceased to be an influential voice in Indian politics.\n\nFollowing Menon's political eclipse, Moscow's preferred candidate to succeed Nehru after his death in May 1964, was Gulzarilal Nanda, Home Minister and number two in the cabinet. The Delhi residency was ordered to do all it could to further his candidature but to switch support to Lal Bahadur Shastri, also a close associate of Nehru, if Nanda's campaign failed. There is no indication in the files noted by Mitrokhin that the KGB was in contact with either Nanda or Shastri. Moscow's main reason for supporting them was almost certainly, negative rather than positive-to prevent the right-wing Hindu traditionalist Morarji Desai, who began each day by drinking a glass of his own urine (a practice extolled in ancient Indian medical treatises), from succeeding Nehru. In the event, after Desai had been persuaded to withdraw reluctantly from the contest, Shastri became Prime Minister with the unanimous backing of Congress. Following Shastri's sudden death in January 1966, the cabal of Congress leaders (the 'Syndicate\u2019) chose Nehru's daughter, Indira Gandhi (codenamed VANO by the KGB), as his successor in the mistaken belief that she would prove a popular figurehead whom they could manipulate at will.\n\nThe KGB's first prolonged contact with Indira Gandhi had occurred during her first visit to the Soviet Union a few months after Stalin's death in 1953. As well as keeping her under continuous surveillance, the Second Chief Directorate also surrounded her with handsome, attentive male admirers. Unaware of the orchestration of her welcome by the KGB, Indira was overwhelmed by the attentions lavished on her. Though she did not mention the male admirers in letters to her father, she wrote to him, 'Everybody-the Russians-have been so sweet to me... I am being treated like everybody's only daughter-I shall be horribly spoilt by the time I leave. Nobody has ever been so nice to me.' Indira wrote of a holiday arranged for her on the Black Sea, \u2018I don't think I have had such a holiday for years\u2019. Later, in Leningrad, she told Nehru that she was 'wallowing in luxury'. Two years later Indira accompanied her father on his first official visit to the Soviet Union. Like Nehru, she was visibly impressed by the apparent successes of Soviet planning and economic modernization exhibited to them in carefully stage-managed visits to Russian factories. During her trip, Khrushchev presented her with a mink coat which became one of the favorite items in her wardrobe-despite the fact that a few years earlier she had criticized the female Indian ambassador in Moscow for accepting a similar gift.\n\nSoviet attempts to cultivate Indira Gandhi during the 1950s were motivated far more by the desire to influence her father than by any awareness of her own political potential. Like both the Congress Syndicate and the CPI, Moscow still underestimated her when she became Prime Minister. During her early appearances in parliament, Mrs. Gandhi seemed tongue-tied and unable to think on her feet. The insulting nickname coined by a socialist MP, 'Dumb Doll\u2019 began to stick. Moscow's strategy during 1966 for the Indian elections in the following year was based on encouraging the CPI and the breakaway Communist Party of India, Marxist (CPM) to join together in a left-wing alliance to oppose Mrs. Gandhi and the Congress government. As well as subsidizing the CPI and some other left-wing groups during the 1967 election campaign, the KGB also funded the campaigns of several agents and confidential contacts within Congress. The most senior agent identified in the files noted by Mitrokhin was a minister codenamed ABAD, who was regarded by the KGB as 'extremely influential'.\n\nDuring the election campaign, the KGB also made considerable use of active measures, many of them based on forged American documents produced by Service A. An agent in the information department of the US embassy in New Delhi, codenamed MIKHAIL, provided examples of documents and samples of signatures to assist in the production of convincing forgeries. Among the operations officers who publicized the forgeries produced for the 1967 election campaign was Yuri Modin, former controller of the Cambridge 'Magnificent Five'. In an attempt to discredit S.K. Patil, one of the leading anti-Communists in the Congress Syndicate, Modin circulated a forged letter from the US consul-general in Bombay to the American ambassador in New Delhi referring to Patil\u2019s political intrigues with the Pakistanis' and to the large American subsidies supposedly given to him. Though Patil was one of the most senior Congress politicians defeated at the election, it remains difficult to assess how much his defeat owed to KGB active measures. Modin also publicized a bogus telegram to London from the British High Commissioner, John Freeman, reporting that the United States was giving vast sums to right-wing parties and politicians. The fact that the KGB appears to have had no agent like MIKHAIL in the High Commission, however, led Service A on this occasion to make an embarrassing error. Its forgery mistakenly described the British High Commissioner as Sir John Freeman.\n\nOther Service A fabrications had much greater success. Among them was a forged letter purporting to come from Gordon Goldstein of the US Office of Naval Research and revealing the existence of (in reality non-existent) American bacteriological warfare weapons in Vietnam and Thailand. Originally published in the Bombay \u2018Free Press Journal\u2019, the letter was reported in the London \u2018Times\u2019 on 7 March 1968 and used by Moscow Radio in broadcasts beamed at Asia as proof that the United States had spread epidemics in Vietnam. The Indian weekly \u2018Blitz\u2019 headlined a story based on the same forgery, \u2018US Admits Biological and Nuclear Warfare'. Goldstein's signature and official letterhead were subsequently discovered to have been copied from an invitation to an international scientific symposium circulated by him the previous year.\n\nAfter the elections of February 1967, the KGB claimed, doubtless optimistically, that it was able to influence 30 to 40 percent of the new parliament. Congress lost 21 percent of its seats. The conflict between Indira Gandhi and her chief rival Morarji Desai made its forty-four-seat majority precarious and obliged her to accept Desai as Deputy Prime Minister. By 1968 Desai and Kamaraj, the head of the Syndicate, were agreed on the need to replace Mrs. Gandhi. Congress was moving inexorably towards a split.\n\nDuring 1969 there were major policy reorientations in both Moscow and Delhi. The growing threat from China persuaded the Kremlin to make a special relationship with India the basis of its South Asian policy. Simultaneously, Mrs. Gandhi set out to secure left-wing support against the Syndicate. In July 1969 she nationalized fourteen commercial banks. Desai was sacked as Finance Minister and resigned as Deputy Prime Minister- Encouraged by Moscow, the CPI swung its support behind Mrs. Gandhi. By infiltrating its members and sympathizers into the left-wing Congress Forum for Socialist Action (codenamed SECTOR by the KGB), the CPI set out to gain a position of influence within the ruling party. In November the Syndicate declared Mrs. Gandhi guilty of defiance of the Congress leadership and dismissed her from the: parry, which then split in two: Congress (O), which followed the Syndicate line, and Congress (R), which supported Mrs. Gandhi. The Syndicate hinted that Mrs. Gandhi intended to 'sell' India to the Soviet Union and was using her principal private secretary, Parmeshwar Narain Haksar, as a direct link with Moscow and the Soviet embassy.\n\nFrom 1967 to 1973 Haksar, a former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Krishna Menon, was Mrs. Gandhi's most trusted adviser. One of her biographers, Katherine Frank, describes him as 'a magnetic figure' who became 'probably the most influential and powerful person in the government' as well as 'the most important civil servant in the country'. Haksar set out to turn a civil service which at least in principle, was politically neutral into an ideologically 'committed bureaucracy'. His was the hand that guided Mrs. Gandhi through her turn to the left, the nationalization of the banks and the split in the Congress Party, It was Haksar also who was behind the transfer of control of the intelligence community to the Prime Minister's Secretariat. His advocacy of the leftward turn in Mrs. Gandhi's policies sprang, however, from his socialist convictions rather than from manipulation by the KGB. But both he and Mrs. Gandhi 'were less fastidious than Nehru had been about interfering with the democratic system and structure of government to attain their ideological ends'. The journalist Inder Malhotra noted the growth of a \u2018courtier culture' in Indira Gandhi's entourage: 'The power centre in the world's largest democracy was slowly turning into a durbar'. At the elections of February 1971 Mrs. Gandhi won a landslide victory. With seventy seats more than the undivided Congress had won in 1967, her Congress (R) had a two-thirds majority. The Congress Forum for Socialist Action had the support of about 100 MPs in the new parliament. Mrs. Gandhi made its most vocal spokesman, the former Communist Mohan Kumaramangalam, Minister of Mines; one of his first acts was the nationalization of the coal industry. Kumaramangalam seemed to be implementing a 'thesis' which he had first argued in 1964: that since the CPI could not win power by itself, as many of its members and sympathizers as possible should join the Congress, make common cause with 'progressive' Congressmen and compel the party leadership to implement socialist policies. Another leading figure in the Congress Forum for Socialist Action was recruited in 1971 as Agent RERO and paid about 100,000 rupees a year for what the KGB considered important political intelligence as well as acting as an agent recruiter. His controllers included the future head of the FCD, Leonid Shebarshin (codenamed VERNOV).\n\nIn August 1971 Mrs. Gandhi signed a Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Co-operation with the Soviet Union, According to the Permanent Secretary at the Indian Foreign Office, T.N. Kaul, it was one of the few closely guarded secret negotiations that India has ever conducted. On \\[the Indian\\] side, hardly half a dozen people were aware of it, including the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister. The media got no scent of it. A delighted Gromyko declared at the signing ceremony, \u2018The significance of the Treaty cannot be over-estimated.' Mrs. Gandhi's popularity among the Soviet people, he later claimed, was demonstrated by the large number of Soviet babies who were given the unusual name Indira. The Soviet Union seemed to be guaranteed the support of the leading power in the Non-Aligned Movement. Both countries immediately issued a joint communiqu\u00e9 calling for the withdrawal of US troops from Vietnam. India was able to rely on Soviet arms supplies and diplomatic support in the conflict against Pakistan which was already in the offing. According to Leonid Shebarshin, who was posted to New Delhi as head of Line PR (political intelligence) at a time when 'Soviet military Technology was flowing into India in an endless stream', the Centre-unlike many in the Foreign Ministry-concluded that war was inevitable. Shebarshin realized that war had begun when the lights went out in the middle of a diplomatic reception at the Soviet embassy on 2 December. Looking out of the window, Shebarshin saw that the power cut affected the whole of the capital. Leaving the embassy hurriedly, he drove to a phone box some way away to ring a member of the residency's agent network who confirmed that hostilities had started. Another member of the network arranged a meeting between Shebarshin and a senior Indian military commander:\n\nIt would fit an understatement to say that the general's mood was optimistic. He knew precisely when and how the war would end: on 16 December with the surrender of Dacca \\[later renamed Dhaka\\] and capitulation of the Pakistani army \\[in East Pakistan\\]... They were in no stare to resist and would not defend Dacca, because they had no one from whom to expect help. 'We know the Pakistani army', my interlocutor said, \u2018Any professional soldiers would behave the same way in their place'.\n\nDespite diplomatic support from both the United States and China, Pakistan suffered a crushing defeat in the fourteen-day war with India. East Pakistan gained independence as Bangladesh, West Pakistan, reduced to a nation of only 55 million people, could no longer mount a credible challenge to India. For most Indians it was Mrs. Gandhi\u2019s finest hour. A Soviet diplomat at the United Nations exulted, \u2018This is the first time in history that the United States and China have been defeated together!'\n\nIn the Centre, the Indo-Soviet special relationship was also celebrated as a triumph for the KGB. The residency in New Delhi was rewarded by being upgraded to the status of 'main residency'. Its head from 1970 to 1975, Yakov Prokofyevich Medyanik, was accorded the title of 'main resident', while the heads of Lines PR (political intelligence), KR (counter-intelligence) and X (scientific and technological intelligence) were each given the rank of resident-not, as elsewhere, deputy resident. Medyanik also had overall supervision of three other residencies, located in the Soviet consulates at Bombay, Calcutta and Madras, In the early 1970s, the KGB presence in India became one of the largest in the world outside the Soviet bloc, Indira Gandhi placed no limit on the number of Soviet diplomats and trade officials, thus allowing the KGB and GRU as many cover positions as they wished. Nor, like many other states, did India object to admitting Soviet intelligence officers who had been expelled by less hospitable regimes. The expansion of KGB operations in the Indian subcontinent (and first and foremost in India) during the early 1970s led the FCD to create a new department. Hitherto operations in India, as in the rest of non-Communist South and South-East Asia, had been the responsibility of the Seventh Department. In 1974 the newly founded Seventeenth Department was given charge of the Indian subcontinent.\n\nOleg Kalugin, who became head of FCD Directorate K (Counter-intelligence) in 1973, remembers India as 'a model of KGB infiltration of a Third World government': 'We had scores of sources throughout the Indian government-in intelligence, counter-intelligence, the Defense and Foreign Ministries, and the police'. In Directorate K, whose responsibilities included the penetration of foreign intelligence and security agencies, was running, through Line KR in the Indian residencies, over thirty agents \u2014 ten of whom were Indian intelligence officers. Kalugin recalls one occasion on which Andropov personally turned down an offer from an Indian minister to provide information in return for $50,000 on the grounds that the KGB was already well supplied with material from the Indian Foreign and Defense Ministries. It seemed like the entire country was for sale; the KGB-and the CIA-had deeply penetrated the Indian government. After a while neither side entrusted sensitive information to the Indians, realizing their enemy would know all about it the next day.\n\nThe KGB, in Kalugin's view, was more successful than the CIA, partly because of its skill in exploiting the corruption which became endemic under Indira Gandhi's regime. As Inder Malhotra noted, though corruption was not new in India:\n\nPeople expected Indira Gandhi's party, committed to bringing socialism to the country, to be more honest and cleaner than the old undivided Congress, But this turned out to be a vain hope. On the contrary, compared with the amassing of wealth by some of her close associates, the misdeeds of the discarded Syndicate leaders once looked upon as godfathers of corrupt Congressmen, began to appear trivial.\n\nSuitcases full of banknotes were said to be routinely taken to the Prime Minister's house. Former Syndicate member S.K. Patil is reported to have said that Mrs. Gandhi did not even return the suitcases.\n\nThe Prime Minister is unlikely to have paid close attention to the dubious origins of some of the funds which went into Congress's coffers. That was a matter which she left largely to her principal fundraiser, Lalit Narayan Mishra, who-though she doubtless did not realize it also accepted Soviet money. On at least one occasion a secret gift of 2 million rupees from the Politburo to Congress (R) was personally delivered after midnight by the head of Line PR in New Delhi, Leonid Shebarshin. Another million rupees were given on the same occasion to a newspaper which supported Mrs. Gandhi. Short and obese with several chins, Mishra looked the part of the corrupt politician he increasingly became. Indira Gandhi, despite her own frugal lifestyle, depended on the money he collected from a variety of sources to finance Congress (R). So did her son and anointed heir, Sanjay, whose misguided ambition to build an Indian popular car and become India's Henry Ford depended on government favours, When Mishra was assassinated in 1975, Mrs. Gandhi blamed a plot involving 'foreign elements\u2019, a phrase which she doubtless intended as a euphemism for the CIA. The New Delhi main residency gave his widow 70,000 rupees from its active-measures budget. Though there were some complaints from the CPI leadership at the use of Soviet funds to support Mrs. Gandhi and Congress (R), 60 covert funding for the CPI seems to have been unaffected. By 1972 the import-export business founded by the CPI a decade earlier to trade with the Soviet Union had contributed more than 10 million rupees to Party funds. Other secret subsidies, totaling at least 1.5 million rupees, had gone to state Communist parties, individuals and media associated with the CPI. The funds which were sent from Moscow to Party headquarters via the KGB were larger still. In the first six months of 1975 alone they amounted to over 2.5 million rupees.\n\nIn the mid-1970s Soviet funds for the CPI were passed by operations officers of the New Delhi main residency to a senior member of the Party's National Council codenamed BANKIR at a number of different locations. The simplest transfers of funds occurred when KGB officers under diplomatic cover had a pretext to visit BANKIR's office, such as his briefings for visiting press delegations from the Soviet bloc. Other arrangements, however, were much more complex- One file noted by Mitrokhin records a fishing expedition to a lake not far from Delhi arranged to provide cover for a transfer of funds to BANKIR. Shebarshin and two operations officers from the main residency left the embassy at 6.30 a.m., arrived at about 8 a.m. and spent two and a half hours fishing. At 10.30 a.m. they left the lake and headed to an agreed rendezvous point with BANKIR, making visual contact with his car at 11.15. As the residency car overtook his on a section of the road which could not be observed from either side, packages of banknotes were passed through the open window of BANKlR's car. Rajeshwar Rao, general secretary of the CPI from 1964 to 1990, subsequently provided receipts for the sums received. Further substantial sums went to the Communist-Led All-India Congress of Trade Unions, headed by S.A. Dange.\n\nIndia under Indira Gandhi was also probably the arena for more KGB active measures than anywhere else in the world, though their significance appears to have been considerably exaggerated by the Centre, which overestimated its ability to manipulate Indian opinion. According to KGB files, by 1973 it had ten Indian newspapers on its payroll (which cannot be identified for legal reasons) as well as a press agency under its control. During 1972 the KGB claimed to have planted 3,789 articles in Indian newspapers-probably more than in any other country in the non-Communist world. According to its files, the number fell to 2,760 in 1973 but rose to 4,486 in 1974 and 5,510 in 1975.66 In some major NATO countries, despite active-measures campaigns, the KGB was able to plant little more than 1 percent of the articles which it placed in the Indian press.\n\nAmong the KGB's leading confidential contacts in the press was one of India's most influential journalists, codenamed NOK, Recruited as a confidential contact in 1976 by A.A. Arkhipov, NOK was subsequently handled by two Line PR officers operating under journalistic cover: first A.I. Khachaturian, officially a Trud correspondent, then V.N. Cherepakhin of the Novosti news agency. NOK's file records that he published material favorable to the Soviet Union and provided information on the entourage of Indira Gandhi. Contact with him ceased in 1980 as a result of his deteriorating health. Though not apparently aware of the KGB's involvement in the active-measures campaign, P.N. Dhar believed that the left was 'manipulating the press... to keep Mrs. Gandhi committed to their ideological line'. India was also one of the most favorable environments for Soviet front organizations. From 1966 to 1986 the head of the most important of them, the World Peace Council (WPC), was the Indian Communist Romesh Chandra. In his review of the 1960s at the WPC-sponsored World Peace Congress I, Chandra denounced 'the US-dominated NATO' as 'the greatest threat to peace' across the world: 'The fangs of NATO can be felt in Asia and Africa as well \\[as Europe\\]\u2026 The forces of imperialism and exploitation, particularly NATO... bear the responsibility for the hunger and poverty of hundreds of millions all over the world.'\n\nThe KGB was also confident of its ability to organize mass demonstrations in Delhi and other major cities. In 1969, for example Andropov informed the Politburo, 'The KGB residency in India has the opportunity to organize a protest demonstration of up to 20,000 Muslims in front of the US embassy in India-The cost of the demonstration would be 5,000 rupees and would be covered in the... budget for special tasks in India. I request consideration'. Brezhnev wrote 'Agreed' on Andropov's request. In April 1971, two months after Mrs. Gandhi's landslide election victory, the Politburo approved the establishment of a secret fund of 1.5 million convertible rubles (codenamed DEPO) to fund active-measures operations in India over the next four years. During that period KGB reports from New Delhi claimed on slender evidence, to have assisted the success of Congress (R) in elections to state assemblies.\n\nAmong the most time-consuming active measures implemented by Leonid Shebarshin as head of Line PR were the preparations for Brezhnev's state visit in 1973. As usual it was necessary to ensure that the General Secretary was received with what appeared to be rapturous enthusiasm and to concoct evidence that his platitudinous speeches were hailed as 'major political statements of tremendous importance'. Since Brezhnev was probably the dreariest orator among the world's major statesmen this was no easy task, particularly when he traveled outside the Soviet bloc. Soviet audiences were used to listening respectfully to his long-winded utterances and to bursting into regular, unwarranted applause. Indian audiences, however, lacked the experience of their Soviet counterparts. Brezhnev would have been affronted by any suggestion that he deliver only a short address, since he believed in a direct correlation between the length of a speech and the prestige of the speaker. His open-air speech in the great square in front of Delhi's famous Red Fort, where Nehru had declared Indian independence twenty-six years earlier, thus presented a particular challenge. According to possibly inflated KGB estimates, 2 million people were present-perhaps the largest audience to whom Brezhnev had ever spoken. As Shebarshin later acknowledged, the speech was extraordinarily long winded and heavy going. The embassy had made matters even worse by translating the speech into a form of high Hindi which was incomprehensible to most of the audience. As the speech droned on and night began to fall, some of the audience started to drift away but, according to Shebarshin, were turned back by the police for fear of offending the Soviet leader. Though even Brezhnev sensed that not all was well, he was later reassured by the practiced sycophants in his entourage.\n\nShebarshin was able to persuade both himself and the Centre that the visit as a whole had been a great success. The KGB claimed much of the credit for 'creating favorable conditions' for Brezhnev's Indian triumph.\n\nLeonid Shebarshin's perceived success in active measures as head of Line PR almost certainly helps to explain his promotion to the post of main resident in 1975 and launched him on a career which in 1988 took him to the leadership of the FCD. In a newspaper interview after his retirement from the KGB, Shebarshin spoke 'nostalgically about the old days, about disinformation- forging documents, creating sensations for the press'. It was doubtless his days in India which he had chiefly in mind. Among the KGB's most successful active measures were those which claimed to expose CIA plots in the subcontinent. The Centre was probably right to claim the credit for persuading Indira Gandhi that the Agency was plotting her overthrow. In November 1973 she told Fidel Castro at a banquet in New Delhi, 'What they \\[the CIA\\] have done to Allende they want to do to me also. There are people here, connected with the same foreign forces that acted in Chile, who would like to eliminate me.' She did not question Castro's (and the KGB's) insistence that Allende had been murdered in cold blood by Pinochet's US-backed troops. The belief that the Agency had marked her out for the same fate as Allende became something of an obsession. In an obvious reference to (accurate) American claims that, in reality, Allende had turned his gun on himself during the storming of his palace, Mrs. Gandhi declared, 'When I am murdered, they will say I arranged it myself'.\n\nMrs. Gandhi was also easily persuaded that the CIA, rather than the mistakes of her own administration, was responsible for the growing opposition to her government. Early in 1974 riots in Gujarat, which killed over 100 people, led to 8,000 arrests and caused the dissolution of the State Assembly, reinforced her belief In an American conspiracy against her. Irritated by a series of speeches by Mrs. Gandhi denouncing the ever-present menace of CIA subversion, the US ambassador in New Delhi, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, ordered an investigation which uncovered two occasions during her father's premiership when the CIA had secretly provided funds to help the Communists' opponents in state elections, once in Kerala (money provided to the Christian church for the 'Vimochana Samaram') and once in West Bengal- According to Moynihan: \n\nBoth times the money was given to the Congress Party which had asked for it-Once it was given to Mrs. Gandhi herself, who was then a party official.\n\nStill, as we were no longer giving any money to her it was understandable that she should wonder to whom we were giving it. It is not a practice to be encouraged.\n\nA brief visit to India by Henry Kissinger in October 1974 provided another opportunity for a KGB active-measures campaign. Agents of influence were given further fabricated stories about CIA conspiracies to report to the Prime Minister and other leading figures in the government and parliament. The KGB claimed to have planted over seventy stories in the Indian press condemning CIA subversion as well as initiating letter-writing and poster campaigns. The Delhi main residency claimed that, thanks to its campaign, Mrs. Gandhi had raised the question of CIA operations in India during her talks with Kissinger.\n\nOn 28 April 1975 Andropov approved a further Indian active-measures operation to publicize fabricated evidence of CIA subversion. Sixteen packets containing incriminating material prepared by Service A on three CIA officers stationed under diplomatic cover at the US embassy were sent anonymously by the Delhi residency to the media and gave rise to a series of articles in the Indian press. According to KGB files, Mrs. Gandhi sent a personal letter to the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, enclosing some of the KGB's forged CIA documents and a series of articles in Indian newspapers which had been taken in by them. The same files report that Mrs. Bandaranaike concluded that CIA subversion posed such a serious threat to Sri Lanka that she set up a committee of investigation.\n\nOne of Mrs. Gandhi's critics, Piloo Moody, ridiculed her obsession with CIA subversion by wearing around his neck a medallion with the slogan, 'I am a CIA agent'. For Mrs. Gandhi, however, the Agency was no laughing matter. By the summer of 1975 her suspicions of a vast conspiracy by her political opponents, aided and abetted by the CIA, had, in the opinion of her biographer Katherine Frank, grown to 'something close to paranoia'. Her mood was further darkened on 12 June by a decision of the Allahabad High Court, against which she appealed, invalidating her election as MP on the grounds of irregularities in the 1971 elections. A fortnight later she persuaded both the President and the cabinet to agree to the declaration of a state of emergency.\n\n(to be continued)",

When he defected to the United Kingdom in 1992 he brought the archive with him.\n&lt;a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitrokhin_Archive\"&gt;The Mitrokhin Archive Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A chapter from the book &amp;#39;The Mitrokhin Archive II: The KGB and the World&amp;#39; shows that Indira Gandhi was on the payroll of KGB. The whole nation was on the payroll of KGB and even ISI. Indira was put in place by murdering Lal Bahadur Shastri, the second PM of India, by the KGB.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;The Special Relationship With India&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 1: The supremacy of the Indian National Congress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Third World country on which the KGB eventually concentrated most operational effort during the Cold War was India. Under Stalin, however, India had been regarded as an imperialist puppet. The Great Soviet Encyclopedia dismissed Mohandas &amp;#39;Mahatma&amp;#39; Gandhi, who led India to independence in 1947, as &amp;#39;a reactionary\u2026. who betrayed the people and helped the imperialists against them; aped the ascetics; pretended in a demagogic way to be a supporter of Indian independence and an enemy of the British; and widely exploited religious prejudice&amp;#39;. Despite his distaste for Stalinist attacks Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of independent India, &amp;#39;had no doubt that the Soviet revolution had advanced human society by a great leap and had lit a bright flame which could not be smothered&amp;#39;. Though later eulogized by Soviet writers as \u2018a leader of international magnitude who ranked &amp;#39;among the best minds of the twentieth century&amp;#39;, Nehru was well aware that until Stalin&amp;#39;s death in 1953 he, like Gandhi, was regarded as a reactionary. During the early years of Indian independence, secret correspondence from Moscow to the Communist Party of India (CPI) was frequently intercepted by the Intelligence Branch (IB) in New Delhi (as it had been when the IB was working for the British Raj). According to the head of the IB, B. N. Mullik, until the early 1950s &amp;#39;every instruction that had issued from Moscow had expressed the necessity and importance [for] the Indian Communist Party to overthrow the &amp;quot;reactionary&amp;quot; Nehru Government&amp;#39;. Early in 1951 Mullik gave Nehru a copy of the latest exhortations from Moscow to the CPI, which contained a warning that they must not fall into government hands. Nehru &amp;#39;laughed out loud and remarked that Moscow apparently did not know how smart our Intelligence was&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Neither Nehru nor the IB, however, realized how thoroughly the Indian embassy in Moscow was being penetrated by the KGB, using its usual varieties of the honey trap. The Indian diplomat PROKHOR (code name given for the Indian by KGB) was recruited, probably in the early 1950s, with the help of a female swallow (a female Russian prostitute/spy), codenamed NEVEROVA, who presumably seduced him. The KGB was clearly pleased with the material which PROKHOR provided, which included on two occasions the embassy code-book and deciphering tables, since in 1954 it increased his monthly payments from 1,000 to 4,000 rupees. Another Indian diplomat, RADAR, was recruited in 1956, also with the assistance of a swallow, who on this occasion claimed (probably falsely) to be pregnant. A third KGB swallow persuaded a cipher clerk in the Indian embassy, ARTUR, to go heavily into debt in order to make it easier to compromise him. He was recruited as an agent in 1957 after being trapped (probably into illegal currency dealing) by a KGB officer posing as a black-marketeer. As a result of these and other penetrations of the embassy, Soviet code breakers were probably able to decrypt substantial numbers of Indian diplomatic communications.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As KGB operations in India expanded during the 1950s and 1960s, the Centre seems to have discovered the extent of the IB&amp;#39;s previous penetration of the CPI. According to a KGB report, an investigation into Promode Das Gupta, who became secretary of the Bengal Communist Party in 1959, concluded that he had been recruited by the IB in 1947. Further significant IB penetrations were discovered in the Kerala and Madras parties. By the 1960s KGB penetration of the Indian intelligence community and other parts of its official bureaucracy had enabled it to turn the tables on the IB. After the KGB became the main conduit for both money and secret communications from Moscow, high-level IB penetration of the CPI (Communist Party of India) became much more difficult. As in other Communist parties, this secret channel was known only to a small inner circle within the leadership. In 1959 the CPI General Secretary, Ajoy Ghosh, agreed With the Delhi residency on plans to fund an import-export business for trade with the Soviet bloc, headed by a senior Party member codenamed DED, whose profits would be creamed off for &amp;quot;party funds\u201d. Within little more than a decade its annual profits had grown to over 3 million rupees. The Soviet news agency Novosti provided further subsidies by routinely paying the CPI publishing House at a rate 50 percent above its normal charges.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moscow&amp;#39;s interest in Nehru was greatly enhanced by his emergence (together with Nasser and Tito) as one of the leaders of the Non-Aligned Movement, which began to take shape at the Bandung Conference in 1955, An exchange of official visits in the same year by Nehru and Khrushchev opened a new era in Indo-Soviet relations. On his return from India in December, Khrushchev reported to the Presidium that he had received a warm welcome, but criticized the &amp;#39;primitive&amp;#39; portrayal of India in Soviet publications and films which demonstrated a poor grasp of Indian culture. Khrushchev was, however, clearly pleased with the intelligence and personal security provided by the KGB during his trip and proposed that the officers concerned be decorated and considered for salary increases American reliance on Pakistan as a strategic counterweight to Soviet influence in Asia encouraged India to turn to the USSR. In 1956 Nehru declared that he had never encountered a &amp;#39;grosser case of naked aggression&amp;#39; than the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt, but failed to condemn the brutal Soviet suppression of the Hungarian Uprising in the same year. India voted against a UN resolution calling for free elections in Hungary and the withdrawal of Soviet forces. The Kremlin increasingly valued Indian support as, with growing frequency, the Non-Aligned Movement tended to vote in the UN with the Soviet bloc rather than the West. During the 1960s India and the Soviet Union found further common cause against Mao&amp;#39;s China.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Within Nehru&amp;#39;s Congress Party government the KGB set out to cultivate its leading left-wing firebrand and Nehru&amp;#39;s close adviser, Krishna Menon, who became Minister of Defense in 1957 after spending most of the previous decade as, successively, Indian High Commissioner in London and representative at the United Nations. To the Soviet Foreign Minister, Andrei Gromyko, &amp;#39;It was\u2026\u2026. plain that [Menon] was personally friendly to the Soviet Union. He would say to me heatedly: &amp;quot;You cannot imagine the hatred the Indian people felt and stiff feel to the colonialists, the British\u2026\u2026 The methods used by American capital to exploit the backward countries may be oblique, but they&amp;#39;re just as harsh.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In May 1962 the Soviet Presidium (which under Khrushchev replaced the Politburo) authorized the KGB residency in New Delhi to conduct active-measures operations designed to strengthen Menon&amp;#39;s position in India and enhance his personal popularity, probably in the hope that he would become Nehru&amp;#39;s successor. During Menon&amp;#39;s tenure of the Defense Ministry, India&amp;#39;s main source of arms imports switched from the West to the Soviet Union. The Indian decision in the summer of 1962 to purchase MiG-21s rather than British Lightnings was due chiefly to Menon. The British High Commissioner in New Delhi reported to London, \u201cKrishna Menon has from the beginning managed to surround this question with almost conspiratorial official and ministerial secrecy combined with a skillful putting about of stories in favour of the MiG and against Western aircraft\u201d. Menon&amp;#39;s career, however, was disrupted by the Chinese invasion of India in October 1961. Having failed to take the prospect of invasion seriously until the eve of the attack, Menon found himself made the scapegoat for India&amp;#39;s unpreparedness. Following the rout of Indian forces by the Chinese, Nehru reluctantly dismissed him on 31 October. A fortnight later, the Presidium authorized active measures by the Delhi residency, including secret finance for a newspaper which supported Menon, in a forlorn attempt to resuscitate his political career. Though similar active measures by the KGB in Menon&amp;#39;s favour before the 1967 election also had little observable effect, a secret message to Menon from the CPSU Central Committee (probably sent by its International Department) expressed appreciation for his positive attitude to the Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;KGB support did little to revive Menon&amp;#39;s fortunes. Before he became Defense Minister, most of his political career had been spent outside India, including twenty eight years in Britain, where he had served for more than a decade as a Labour councilor in London. As a result, despite the personal support of some ardent disciples within the Congress Party (at least one of whom received substantial KGB funding) Menon lacked any real popular following in India itself. By the time he returned to India from foreign exiles the only language he spoke was English, he could no longer tolerate spicy Indian food and he preferred a tweed jacket and flannel trousers to traditional Indian dress. After failing to be denominated by Congress in his existing Bombay constituency for the 1967 election, Menon stood unsuccessfully as an independent. Two years later, with Communist support, he was elected as an independent in West Bengal. Some of the issues on which he campaigned suggest that he had been influenced by KGB active measures-as, for example, in his demand that American troops in Vietnam be tried for genocide and his claim that they were slitting open the wombs of pregnant women to expose their unborn babies. Well before his death in 1974, however, Menon had ceased to be an influential voice in Indian politics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Following Menon&amp;#39;s political eclipse, Moscow&amp;#39;s preferred candidate to succeed Nehru after his death in May 1964, was Gulzarilal Nanda, Home Minister and number two in the cabinet. The Delhi residency was ordered to do all it could to further his candidature but to switch support to Lal Bahadur Shastri, also a close associate of Nehru, if Nanda&amp;#39;s campaign failed. There is no indication in the files noted by Mitrokhin that the KGB was in contact with either Nanda or Shastri. Moscow&amp;#39;s main reason for supporting them was almost certainly, negative rather than positive-to prevent the right-wing Hindu traditionalist Morarji Desai, who began each day by drinking a glass of his own urine (a practice extolled in ancient Indian medical treatises), from succeeding Nehru. In the event, after Desai had been persuaded to withdraw reluctantly from the contest, Shastri became Prime Minister with the unanimous backing of Congress. Following Shastri&amp;#39;s sudden death in January 1966, the cabal of Congress leaders (the &amp;#39;Syndicate\u2019) chose Nehru&amp;#39;s daughter, Indira Gandhi (codenamed VANO by the KGB), as his successor in the mistaken belief that she would prove a popular figurehead whom they could manipulate at will.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The KGB&amp;#39;s first prolonged contact with Indira Gandhi had occurred during her first visit to the Soviet Union a few months after Stalin&amp;#39;s death in 1953. As well as keeping her under continuous surveillance, the Second Chief Directorate also surrounded her with handsome, attentive male admirers. Unaware of the orchestration of her welcome by the KGB, Indira was overwhelmed by the attentions lavished on her. Though she did not mention the male admirers in letters to her father, she wrote to him, &amp;#39;Everybody-the Russians-have been so sweet to me... I am being treated like everybody&amp;#39;s only daughter-I shall be horribly spoilt by the time I leave. Nobody has ever been so nice to me.&amp;#39; Indira wrote of a holiday arranged for her on the Black Sea, \u2018I don&amp;#39;t think I have had such a holiday for years\u2019. Later, in Leningrad, she told Nehru that she was &amp;#39;wallowing in luxury&amp;#39;. Two years later Indira accompanied her father on his first official visit to the Soviet Union. Like Nehru, she was visibly impressed by the apparent successes of Soviet planning and economic modernization exhibited to them in carefully stage-managed visits to Russian factories. During her trip, Khrushchev presented her with a mink coat which became one of the favorite items in her wardrobe-despite the fact that a few years earlier she had criticized the female Indian ambassador in Moscow for accepting a similar gift.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Soviet attempts to cultivate Indira Gandhi during the 1950s were motivated far more by the desire to influence her father than by any awareness of her own political potential. Like both the Congress Syndicate and the CPI, Moscow still underestimated her when she became Prime Minister. During her early appearances in parliament, Mrs. Gandhi seemed tongue-tied and unable to think on her feet. The insulting nickname coined by a socialist MP, &amp;#39;Dumb Doll\u2019 began to stick. Moscow&amp;#39;s strategy during 1966 for the Indian elections in the following year was based on encouraging the CPI and the breakaway Communist Party of India, Marxist (CPM) to join together in a left-wing alliance to oppose Mrs. Gandhi and the Congress government. As well as subsidizing the CPI and some other left-wing groups during the 1967 election campaign, the KGB also funded the campaigns of several agents and confidential contacts within Congress. The most senior agent identified in the files noted by Mitrokhin was a minister codenamed ABAD, who was regarded by the KGB as &amp;#39;extremely influential&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the election campaign, the KGB also made considerable use of active measures, many of them based on forged American documents produced by Service A. An agent in the information department of the US embassy in New Delhi, codenamed MIKHAIL, provided examples of documents and samples of signatures to assist in the production of convincing forgeries. Among the operations officers who publicized the forgeries produced for the 1967 election campaign was Yuri Modin, former controller of the Cambridge &amp;#39;Magnificent Five&amp;#39;. In an attempt to discredit S.K. Patil, one of the leading anti-Communists in the Congress Syndicate, Modin circulated a forged letter from the US consul-general in Bombay to the American ambassador in New Delhi referring to Patil\u2019s political intrigues with the Pakistanis&amp;#39; and to the large American subsidies supposedly given to him. Though Patil was one of the most senior Congress politicians defeated at the election, it remains difficult to assess how much his defeat owed to KGB active measures. Modin also publicized a bogus telegram to London from the British High Commissioner, John Freeman, reporting that the United States was giving vast sums to right-wing parties and politicians. The fact that the KGB appears to have had no agent like MIKHAIL in the High Commission, however, led Service A on this occasion to make an embarrassing error. Its forgery mistakenly described the British High Commissioner as Sir John Freeman.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other Service A fabrications had much greater success. Among them was a forged letter purporting to come from Gordon Goldstein of the US Office of Naval Research and revealing the existence of (in reality non-existent) American bacteriological warfare weapons in Vietnam and Thailand. Originally published in the Bombay \u2018Free Press Journal\u2019, the letter was reported in the London \u2018Times\u2019 on 7 March 1968 and used by Moscow Radio in broadcasts beamed at Asia as proof that the United States had spread epidemics in Vietnam. The Indian weekly \u2018Blitz\u2019 headlined a story based on the same forgery, \u2018US Admits Biological and Nuclear Warfare&amp;#39;. Goldstein&amp;#39;s signature and official letterhead were subsequently discovered to have been copied from an invitation to an international scientific symposium circulated by him the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the elections of February 1967, the KGB claimed, doubtless optimistically, that it was able to influence 30 to 40 percent of the new parliament. Congress lost 21 percent of its seats. The conflict between Indira Gandhi and her chief rival Morarji Desai made its forty-four-seat majority precarious and obliged her to accept Desai as Deputy Prime Minister. By 1968 Desai and Kamaraj, the head of the Syndicate, were agreed on the need to replace Mrs. Gandhi. Congress was moving inexorably towards a split.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During 1969 there were major policy reorientations in both Moscow and Delhi. The growing threat from China persuaded the Kremlin to make a special relationship with India the basis of its South Asian policy. Simultaneously, Mrs. Gandhi set out to secure left-wing support against the Syndicate. In July 1969 she nationalized fourteen commercial banks. Desai was sacked as Finance Minister and resigned as Deputy Prime Minister- Encouraged by Moscow, the CPI swung its support behind Mrs. Gandhi. By infiltrating its members and sympathizers into the left-wing Congress Forum for Socialist Action (codenamed SECTOR by the KGB), the CPI set out to gain a position of influence within the ruling party. In November the Syndicate declared Mrs. Gandhi guilty of defiance of the Congress leadership and dismissed her from the: parry, which then split in two: Congress (O), which followed the Syndicate line, and Congress (R), which supported Mrs. Gandhi. The Syndicate hinted that Mrs. Gandhi intended to &amp;#39;sell&amp;#39; India to the Soviet Union and was using her principal private secretary, Parmeshwar Narain Haksar, as a direct link with Moscow and the Soviet embassy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From 1967 to 1973 Haksar, a former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Krishna Menon, was Mrs. Gandhi&amp;#39;s most trusted adviser. One of her biographers, Katherine Frank, describes him as &amp;#39;a magnetic figure&amp;#39; who became &amp;#39;probably the most influential and powerful person in the government&amp;#39; as well as &amp;#39;the most important civil servant in the country&amp;#39;. Haksar set out to turn a civil service which at least in principle, was politically neutral into an ideologically &amp;#39;committed bureaucracy&amp;#39;. His was the hand that guided Mrs. Gandhi through her turn to the left, the nationalization of the banks and the split in the Congress Party, It was Haksar also who was behind the transfer of control of the intelligence community to the Prime Minister&amp;#39;s Secretariat. His advocacy of the leftward turn in Mrs. Gandhi&amp;#39;s policies sprang, however, from his socialist convictions rather than from manipulation by the KGB. But both he and Mrs. Gandhi &amp;#39;were less fastidious than Nehru had been about interfering with the democratic system and structure of government to attain their ideological ends&amp;#39;. The journalist Inder Malhotra noted the growth of a \u2018courtier culture&amp;#39; in Indira Gandhi&amp;#39;s entourage: &amp;#39;The power centre in the world&amp;#39;s largest democracy was slowly turning into a durbar&amp;#39;. At the elections of February 1971 Mrs. Gandhi won a landslide victory. With seventy seats more than the undivided Congress had won in 1967, her Congress (R) had a two-thirds majority. The Congress Forum for Socialist Action had the support of about 100 MPs in the new parliament. Mrs. Gandhi made its most vocal spokesman, the former Communist Mohan Kumaramangalam, Minister of Mines; one of his first acts was the nationalization of the coal industry. Kumaramangalam seemed to be implementing a &amp;#39;thesis&amp;#39; which he had first argued in 1964: that since the CPI could not win power by itself, as many of its members and sympathizers as possible should join the Congress, make common cause with &amp;#39;progressive&amp;#39; Congressmen and compel the party leadership to implement socialist policies. Another leading figure in the Congress Forum for Socialist Action was recruited in 1971 as Agent RERO and paid about 100,000 rupees a year for what the KGB considered important political intelligence as well as acting as an agent recruiter. His controllers included the future head of the FCD, Leonid Shebarshin (codenamed VERNOV).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In August 1971 Mrs. Gandhi signed a Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Co-operation with the Soviet Union, According to the Permanent Secretary at the Indian Foreign Office, T.N. Kaul, it was one of the few closely guarded secret negotiations that India has ever conducted. On [the Indian] side, hardly half a dozen people were aware of it, including the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister. The media got no scent of it. A delighted Gromyko declared at the signing ceremony, \u2018The significance of the Treaty cannot be over-estimated.&amp;#39; Mrs. Gandhi&amp;#39;s popularity among the Soviet people, he later claimed, was demonstrated by the large number of Soviet babies who were given the unusual name Indira. The Soviet Union seemed to be guaranteed the support of the leading power in the Non-Aligned Movement. Both countries immediately issued a joint communiqu\u00e9 calling for the withdrawal of US troops from Vietnam. India was able to rely on Soviet arms supplies and diplomatic support in the conflict against Pakistan which was already in the offing. According to Leonid Shebarshin, who was posted to New Delhi as head of Line PR (political intelligence) at a time when &amp;#39;Soviet military Technology was flowing into India in an endless stream&amp;#39;, the Centre-unlike many in the Foreign Ministry-concluded that war was inevitable. Shebarshin realized that war had begun when the lights went out in the middle of a diplomatic reception at the Soviet embassy on 2 December. Looking out of the window, Shebarshin saw that the power cut affected the whole of the capital. Leaving the embassy hurriedly, he drove to a phone box some way away to ring a member of the residency&amp;#39;s agent network who confirmed that hostilities had started. Another member of the network arranged a meeting between Shebarshin and a senior Indian military commander:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would fit an understatement to say that the general&amp;#39;s mood was optimistic. He knew precisely when and how the war would end: on 16 December with the surrender of Dacca [later renamed Dhaka] and capitulation of the Pakistani army [in East Pakistan]... They were in no stare to resist and would not defend Dacca, because they had no one from whom to expect help. &amp;#39;We know the Pakistani army&amp;#39;, my interlocutor said, \u2018Any professional soldiers would behave the same way in their place&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite diplomatic support from both the United States and China, Pakistan suffered a crushing defeat in the fourteen-day war with India. East Pakistan gained independence as Bangladesh, West Pakistan, reduced to a nation of only 55 million people, could no longer mount a credible challenge to India. For most Indians it was Mrs. Gandhi\u2019s finest hour. A Soviet diplomat at the United Nations exulted, \u2018This is the first time in history that the United States and China have been defeated together!&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the Centre, the Indo-Soviet special relationship was also celebrated as a triumph for the KGB. The residency in New Delhi was rewarded by being upgraded to the status of &amp;#39;main residency&amp;#39;. Its head from 1970 to 1975, Yakov Prokofyevich Medyanik, was accorded the title of &amp;#39;main resident&amp;#39;, while the heads of Lines PR (political intelligence), KR (counter-intelligence) and X (scientific and technological intelligence) were each given the rank of resident-not, as elsewhere, deputy resident. Medyanik also had overall supervision of three other residencies, located in the Soviet consulates at Bombay, Calcutta and Madras, In the early 1970s, the KGB presence in India became one of the largest in the world outside the Soviet bloc, Indira Gandhi placed no limit on the number of Soviet diplomats and trade officials, thus allowing the KGB and GRU as many cover positions as they wished. Nor, like many other states, did India object to admitting Soviet intelligence officers who had been expelled by less hospitable regimes. The expansion of KGB operations in the Indian subcontinent (and first and foremost in India) during the early 1970s led the FCD to create a new department. Hitherto operations in India, as in the rest of non-Communist South and South-East Asia, had been the responsibility of the Seventh Department. In 1974 the newly founded Seventeenth Department was given charge of the Indian subcontinent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oleg Kalugin, who became head of FCD Directorate K (Counter-intelligence) in 1973, remembers India as &amp;#39;a model of KGB infiltration of a Third World government&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;We had scores of sources throughout the Indian government-in intelligence, counter-intelligence, the Defense and Foreign Ministries, and the police&amp;#39;. In Directorate K, whose responsibilities included the penetration of foreign intelligence and security agencies, was running, through Line KR in the Indian residencies, over thirty agents \u2014 ten of whom were Indian intelligence officers. Kalugin recalls one occasion on which Andropov personally turned down an offer from an Indian minister to provide information in return for $50,000 on the grounds that the KGB was already well supplied with material from the Indian Foreign and Defense Ministries. It seemed like the entire country was for sale; the KGB-and the CIA-had deeply penetrated the Indian government. After a while neither side entrusted sensitive information to the Indians, realizing their enemy would know all about it the next day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The KGB, in Kalugin&amp;#39;s view, was more successful than the CIA, partly because of its skill in exploiting the corruption which became endemic under Indira Gandhi&amp;#39;s regime. As Inder Malhotra noted, though corruption was not new in India:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People expected Indira Gandhi&amp;#39;s party, committed to bringing socialism to the country, to be more honest and cleaner than the old undivided Congress, But this turned out to be a vain hope. On the contrary, compared with the amassing of wealth by some of her close associates, the misdeeds of the discarded Syndicate leaders once looked upon as godfathers of corrupt Congressmen, began to appear trivial.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suitcases full of banknotes were said to be routinely taken to the Prime Minister&amp;#39;s house. Former Syndicate member S.K. Patil is reported to have said that Mrs. Gandhi did not even return the suitcases.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister is unlikely to have paid close attention to the dubious origins of some of the funds which went into Congress&amp;#39;s coffers. That was a matter which she left largely to her principal fundraiser, Lalit Narayan Mishra, who-though she doubtless did not realize it also accepted Soviet money. On at least one occasion a secret gift of 2 million rupees from the Politburo to Congress (R) was personally delivered after midnight by the head of Line PR in New Delhi, Leonid Shebarshin. Another million rupees were given on the same occasion to a newspaper which supported Mrs. Gandhi. Short and obese with several chins, Mishra looked the part of the corrupt politician he increasingly became. Indira Gandhi, despite her own frugal lifestyle, depended on the money he collected from a variety of sources to finance Congress (R). So did her son and anointed heir, Sanjay, whose misguided ambition to build an Indian popular car and become India&amp;#39;s Henry Ford depended on government favours, When Mishra was assassinated in 1975, Mrs. Gandhi blamed a plot involving &amp;#39;foreign elements\u2019, a phrase which she doubtless intended as a euphemism for the CIA. The New Delhi main residency gave his widow 70,000 rupees from its active-measures budget. Though there were some complaints from the CPI leadership at the use of Soviet funds to support Mrs. Gandhi and Congress (R), 60 covert funding for the CPI seems to have been unaffected. By 1972 the import-export business founded by the CPI a decade earlier to trade with the Soviet Union had contributed more than 10 million rupees to Party funds. Other secret subsidies, totaling at least 1.5 million rupees, had gone to state Communist parties, individuals and media associated with the CPI. The funds which were sent from Moscow to Party headquarters via the KGB were larger still. In the first six months of 1975 alone they amounted to over 2.5 million rupees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the mid-1970s Soviet funds for the CPI were passed by operations officers of the New Delhi main residency to a senior member of the Party&amp;#39;s National Council codenamed BANKIR at a number of different locations. The simplest transfers of funds occurred when KGB officers under diplomatic cover had a pretext to visit BANKIR&amp;#39;s office, such as his briefings for visiting press delegations from the Soviet bloc. Other arrangements, however, were much more complex- One file noted by Mitrokhin records a fishing expedition to a lake not far from Delhi arranged to provide cover for a transfer of funds to BANKIR. Shebarshin and two operations officers from the main residency left the embassy at 6.30 a.m., arrived at about 8 a.m. and spent two and a half hours fishing. At 10.30 a.m. they left the lake and headed to an agreed rendezvous point with BANKIR, making visual contact with his car at 11.15. As the residency car overtook his on a section of the road which could not be observed from either side, packages of banknotes were passed through the open window of BANKlR&amp;#39;s car. Rajeshwar Rao, general secretary of the CPI from 1964 to 1990, subsequently provided receipts for the sums received. Further substantial sums went to the Communist-Led All-India Congress of Trade Unions, headed by S.A. Dange.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;India under Indira Gandhi was also probably the arena for more KGB active measures than anywhere else in the world, though their significance appears to have been considerably exaggerated by the Centre, which overestimated its ability to manipulate Indian opinion. According to KGB files, by 1973 it had ten Indian newspapers on its payroll (which cannot be identified for legal reasons) as well as a press agency under its control. During 1972 the KGB claimed to have planted 3,789 articles in Indian newspapers-probably more than in any other country in the non-Communist world. According to its files, the number fell to 2,760 in 1973 but rose to 4,486 in 1974 and 5,510 in 1975.66 In some major NATO countries, despite active-measures campaigns, the KGB was able to plant little more than 1 percent of the articles which it placed in the Indian press.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Among the KGB&amp;#39;s leading confidential contacts in the press was one of India&amp;#39;s most influential journalists, codenamed NOK, Recruited as a confidential contact in 1976 by A.A. Arkhipov, NOK was subsequently handled by two Line PR officers operating under journalistic cover: first A.I. Khachaturian, officially a Trud correspondent, then V.N. Cherepakhin of the Novosti news agency. NOK&amp;#39;s file records that he published material favorable to the Soviet Union and provided information on the entourage of Indira Gandhi. Contact with him ceased in 1980 as a result of his deteriorating health. Though not apparently aware of the KGB&amp;#39;s involvement in the active-measures campaign, P.N. Dhar believed that the left was &amp;#39;manipulating the press... to keep Mrs. Gandhi committed to their ideological line&amp;#39;. India was also one of the most favorable environments for Soviet front organizations. From 1966 to 1986 the head of the most important of them, the World Peace Council (WPC), was the Indian Communist Romesh Chandra. In his review of the 1960s at the WPC-sponsored World Peace Congress I, Chandra denounced &amp;#39;the US-dominated NATO&amp;#39; as &amp;#39;the greatest threat to peace&amp;#39; across the world: &amp;#39;The fangs of NATO can be felt in Asia and Africa as well [as Europe]\u2026 The forces of imperialism and exploitation, particularly NATO... bear the responsibility for the hunger and poverty of hundreds of millions all over the world.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The KGB was also confident of its ability to organize mass demonstrations in Delhi and other major cities. In 1969, for example Andropov informed the Politburo, &amp;#39;The KGB residency in India has the opportunity to organize a protest demonstration of up to 20,000 Muslims in front of the US embassy in India-The cost of the demonstration would be 5,000 rupees and would be covered in the... budget for special tasks in India. I request consideration&amp;#39;. Brezhnev wrote &amp;#39;Agreed&amp;#39; on Andropov&amp;#39;s request. In April 1971, two months after Mrs. Gandhi&amp;#39;s landslide election victory, the Politburo approved the establishment of a secret fund of 1.5 million convertible rubles (codenamed DEPO) to fund active-measures operations in India over the next four years. During that period KGB reports from New Delhi claimed on slender evidence, to have assisted the success of Congress (R) in elections to state assemblies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Among the most time-consuming active measures implemented by Leonid Shebarshin as head of Line PR were the preparations for Brezhnev&amp;#39;s state visit in 1973. As usual it was necessary to ensure that the General Secretary was received with what appeared to be rapturous enthusiasm and to concoct evidence that his platitudinous speeches were hailed as &amp;#39;major political statements of tremendous importance&amp;#39;. Since Brezhnev was probably the dreariest orator among the world&amp;#39;s major statesmen this was no easy task, particularly when he traveled outside the Soviet bloc. Soviet audiences were used to listening respectfully to his long-winded utterances and to bursting into regular, unwarranted applause. Indian audiences, however, lacked the experience of their Soviet counterparts. Brezhnev would have been affronted by any suggestion that he deliver only a short address, since he believed in a direct correlation between the length of a speech and the prestige of the speaker. His open-air speech in the great square in front of Delhi&amp;#39;s famous Red Fort, where Nehru had declared Indian independence twenty-six years earlier, thus presented a particular challenge. According to possibly inflated KGB estimates, 2 million people were present-perhaps the largest audience to whom Brezhnev had ever spoken. As Shebarshin later acknowledged, the speech was extraordinarily long winded and heavy going. The embassy had made matters even worse by translating the speech into a form of high Hindi which was incomprehensible to most of the audience. As the speech droned on and night began to fall, some of the audience started to drift away but, according to Shebarshin, were turned back by the police for fear of offending the Soviet leader. Though even Brezhnev sensed that not all was well, he was later reassured by the practiced sycophants in his entourage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shebarshin was able to persuade both himself and the Centre that the visit as a whole had been a great success. The KGB claimed much of the credit for &amp;#39;creating favorable conditions&amp;#39; for Brezhnev&amp;#39;s Indian triumph.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leonid Shebarshin&amp;#39;s perceived success in active measures as head of Line PR almost certainly helps to explain his promotion to the post of main resident in 1975 and launched him on a career which in 1988 took him to the leadership of the FCD. In a newspaper interview after his retirement from the KGB, Shebarshin spoke &amp;#39;nostalgically about the old days, about disinformation- forging documents, creating sensations for the press&amp;#39;. It was doubtless his days in India which he had chiefly in mind. Among the KGB&amp;#39;s most successful active measures were those which claimed to expose CIA plots in the subcontinent. The Centre was probably right to claim the credit for persuading Indira Gandhi that the Agency was plotting her overthrow. In November 1973 she told Fidel Castro at a banquet in New Delhi, &amp;#39;What they [the CIA] have done to Allende they want to do to me also. There are people here, connected with the same foreign forces that acted in Chile, who would like to eliminate me.&amp;#39; She did not question Castro&amp;#39;s (and the KGB&amp;#39;s) insistence that Allende had been murdered in cold blood by Pinochet&amp;#39;s US-backed troops. The belief that the Agency had marked her out for the same fate as Allende became something of an obsession. In an obvious reference to (accurate) American claims that, in reality, Allende had turned his gun on himself during the storming of his palace, Mrs. Gandhi declared, &amp;#39;When I am murdered, they will say I arranged it myself&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Gandhi was also easily persuaded that the CIA, rather than the mistakes of her own administration, was responsible for the growing opposition to her government. Early in 1974 riots in Gujarat, which killed over 100 people, led to 8,000 arrests and caused the dissolution of the State Assembly, reinforced her belief In an American conspiracy against her. Irritated by a series of speeches by Mrs. Gandhi denouncing the ever-present menace of CIA subversion, the US ambassador in New Delhi, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, ordered an investigation which uncovered two occasions during her father&amp;#39;s premiership when the CIA had secretly provided funds to help the Communists&amp;#39; opponents in state elections, once in Kerala (money provided to the Christian church for the &amp;#39;Vimochana Samaram&amp;#39;) and once in West Bengal- According to Moynihan: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both times the money was given to the Congress Party which had asked for it-Once it was given to Mrs. Gandhi herself, who was then a party official.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still, as we were no longer giving any money to her it was understandable that she should wonder to whom we were giving it. It is not a practice to be encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A brief visit to India by Henry Kissinger in October 1974 provided another opportunity for a KGB active-measures campaign. Agents of influence were given further fabricated stories about CIA conspiracies to report to the Prime Minister and other leading figures in the government and parliament. The KGB claimed to have planted over seventy stories in the Indian press condemning CIA subversion as well as initiating letter-writing and poster campaigns. The Delhi main residency claimed that, thanks to its campaign, Mrs. Gandhi had raised the question of CIA operations in India during her talks with Kissinger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On 28 April 1975 Andropov approved a further Indian active-measures operation to publicize fabricated evidence of CIA subversion. Sixteen packets containing incriminating material prepared by Service A on three CIA officers stationed under diplomatic cover at the US embassy were sent anonymously by the Delhi residency to the media and gave rise to a series of articles in the Indian press. According to KGB files, Mrs. Gandhi sent a personal letter to the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, enclosing some of the KGB&amp;#39;s forged CIA documents and a series of articles in Indian newspapers which had been taken in by them. The same files report that Mrs. Bandaranaike concluded that CIA subversion posed such a serious threat to Sri Lanka that she set up a committee of investigation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of Mrs. Gandhi&amp;#39;s critics, Piloo Moody, ridiculed her obsession with CIA subversion by wearing around his neck a medallion with the slogan, &amp;#39;I am a CIA agent&amp;#39;. For Mrs. Gandhi, however, the Agency was no laughing matter. By the summer of 1975 her suspicions of a vast conspiracy by her political opponents, aided and abetted by the CIA, had, in the opinion of her biographer Katherine Frank, grown to &amp;#39;something close to paranoia&amp;#39;. Her mood was further darkened on 12 June by a decision of the Allahabad High Court, against which she appealed, invalidating her election as MP on the grounds of irregularities in the 1971 elections. A fortnight later she persuaded both the President and the cabinet to agree to the declaration of a state of emergency.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(to be continued)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

     "selftext": "Communists are never exhausted from harping on lofty ideals like democracy and democratic institutions, yet they are the worst destroyers of those very values and institutions raised to protect and nourish them. They are the worst tormentors of civility and culture and why not? The Gods they worship and hang photo frames thereof in their offices are Karl Marx/Lenin/Stalin who espoused violence of every conceivable order/nature to realize their goals and the Doctrine of Violence happens to be very close to their hearts and souls. Founder of the Marxist cult, Karl Marx declared religion to be the opium of masses intoxicating them into artificial/superficial joy. However, does Marxist cult do anything other than poisoning/destroying masses after intoxicating them into false glory of equality?\n\nThere is one more \u2018luminary\u2019 whom they adore, copycat his strategies and actions to obfuscate real issues by preparing an insidiously false grand narrative. He happens to be Hitler\u2019s Propaganda Minister Goebbels. By denying the existence of issues that have the potential to expose their anti-national, sinister activities or embarrass them for their sins of past and by harping on non-existent issues to confound the unsuspecting, is the Dodger\u2019s Art that they have mastered by neatly following Goebbels and his shenanigans. Their nefarious activities have not been brought to the fore as the party that ruled over the country for six decades had been in cahoots with Reds, one of the worst instances of anti-national symbiotic relationships.\n\nBy deriving maximum advantage from their proximity to the ruling establishment, Reds worked out a powerful/well-hinged network of favor-seekers and favor-providers. This nefarious system had been largely responsible to ensure, the nation remained a wretched leader from the bottom in the merit-list of the UN Human Development Index all these years in all disciplines of national reconstruction. Their drum-beating propagandists/acolytes/adherents resort to fantastic arguments viz. \u201cinevitable to cleanse the system of bourgeoisie /reactionaries\u201d to justify every irrational/anti-national/criminal activity of their unworthiness. Their well-oiled false propaganda-reticulum has tarnished the image of the nation abroad and raised several hurdles in attaining laurels that the nation would have been attained otherwise.\n\nThe recent instance of Comrade Sitaram Yechury accusing BJP/RSS of \u201cworming their way into Freedom Movement\u201d notwithstanding the facts that they destroyed Gandhi\u2019s Quit India Movement in cahoots with British-Occupiers and always hobnobbed with them, always condemned hard-earned freedom, are yet other stunning pieces of falsehood. They never took up cudgels to discover much to their enlightenment and discomfiture, thousands of RSS members were the foot-soldiers in freedom movement, every RSS shakha individually sent a congratulatory message to JL Nehru when resolution of \u2018Purna Swaraj\u2019 was passed by Congress in 1929, RSS actively participated in Non-Cooperation Movement in 1930, Quit India Movement with the founder Dr. Hedgewar himself very active from Nagpur to Kolkata with Anusilana Samiti and arrested for sedition in May 1921. During trial for sedition, he thundered in court before the Judge, \u201cIndia belongs to Indians. We, therefore, demand independence. This is the content of all my speeches. People have to be told how to secure independence, and also how to conduct themselves after securing it. What law is there that gives one country the right to rule over the other? I am asking you, the Counsel for Government, this simple and straight question. Can you answer it? Is it not that against natural justice? If it is true that no country has a right to rule over another country, who gave the British the authority to trample the people of India under their feet? How can they enslave us and declare that they own this country? Is it not the most blatant murder of justice, morality and Dharma? Our mind revolts at the thought of remaining the slaves of the British Empire and carrying that stigma for all time. We demand nothing short of complete independence. Till we achieve it we cannot be at peace\u2026.\u201d And Communist Reds periodically declare RSS did nothing to attain independence from British-Occupiers.\n\nReds are so much obsessed with and fear RSS/Hindu  Rightists that whenever and wherever their political outfit BJP is installed in power, they begin undergoing all sorts of hallucinations hollering from rooftops on top of their vocal cords, be it education, foreign policy, internal security or any issue under the sun. In the state of Tamil Nadu, they have their vernacular version in DMK who keenly follow their footsteps in berating Hindu-s and Hinduism. The latest instances have been suggestions to observe Hindi  Week, Guru-Utsava on Teacher\u2019s Day and substitution of German with Samskrita in Central Schools. When Christians sing \u201cOh Jesus, lead us\u2026\u201d, Reds and Dravidians swing to the tune but turn ferociously abusive if Saraswati Vandana is recited. Red-Wolves just hate anything even remotely connected with Hinduism. Hindi movies run for weeks in Tamil Nadu, Dravidian hotheads produce Hindi-hits and progeny of Mother Tamil send their children to English schools even while abusing Hindi uninterruptedly.\n\nMarxist pseudo-historians in cahoots with Nehruvian intellectuals, denigrated all stalwarts of the independence movement, be it Netaji Bose or Sardar Patel. Quite methodically, they established Nehru-Gandhi family as flawless who swear by lofty ideals of democratic values, nourished that through their blood and sweat, others happen to be unworthiness as hangers on to them with a finger in every pie, all achievements of the nation originating from the Dynasty while failures/setbacks crafted by all others. DK Chakravorty, a distinguished historian who taught History / Archaeology at the University of Cambridge, disclosed, \u201cSince coming of this group to power, the world of Indian historical studies has been largely criminalized.\u201d\n\nReds have executed cultural subversion of the country extensively so much so that what external invaders could not do, was adroitly committed by them. Reds and westernized rootless, intellectuals know the power and strength of Sanskrit and the fear of being rendered worthless by Sanskrit looms large in their minds. NASA has declared Sanskrit as the perfect language for advanced scientific calculations and computer programming. Briggs wrote in the issue of Artificial Intelligence 1985, \u201cSanskrit is the perfect language designed for enlightened communication. It is the one and only unambiguous spoken language in the world.\u201d All attempts by Red planted bogus western scholars viz. Wendy Doniger, Arundhati Roy, Sheldon Pollock to defame Hindus and Hinduism have been successfully thwarted so far by a determined group of nationalists whom Reds do not miss even whiff of an opportunity to berate and abuse. Reds do not allow people to believe that the great Hindu civilization adored women, that there were no Dalits /untouchables, that there were no prostitutes at all, that it was an invasion of western bigots that destroyed Hindu civilization and cultural heritage.\n\nSo desperate were they after installation of Modi government in 2014 that they not only engineered murderous assaults on so-called rationalists, the farcical return of awards by literary figures, etc. but also raised the decibel level between two lunatic fringes of society, one faking public opinion and the other, symptomatic of Government policies. They even moved to the extent of declaring; the Idea of India is in a perpetual clash with the Govt. elected with a massive mandate to deliver the Idea of India. It is always that Leftist intellectuals cry wolf loudest. They dread the scenario of losing control of the Indian Council of Historical Research which they monopolize to carry out their nefarious designs of cultural/historical subversions. \u2018Eminent Historians\u2019 authored by Arun Shourie speaks volumes on their \u2018trade\u2019 practices solely meant to perpetuate Red hegemony. Red historian Irfan Habib even went to the extent of castigating revival efforts of the Saraswati river which enjoys enormous value in Vedic wisdom and Hindu civilization. The Marxist historian spent his lifetime proving, the Saraswati river never existed, contrary to all scientific studies, satellite imagery, etc. to the contrary.\n\nFraudulent theory of Aryan Invasion too was propagated Marxists. Also are they hell-bent to negate everything even remotely connected with Sanatana Dharma? Everything good about Hinduism, if at all any, was brought in by Aryan invaders, Alexander brought Vedic wisdom into the country\u2026and Hindus at best, be remembered for having contributed absolutely nothing. The first activity that Marxists undertake is to destroy entire cultural heritage and convert everyone into empty-headed zombies to create space in their minds so as to allow the venomous doctrine of Marxism to take roots in their minds.\n\nReds deviously supported Jinnah\u2019s Direct Action on Aug.16, 1946 and partition of Bharat with the statement in their own words, \u201c\u2026secession would lead to still greater and more glorious unity of India, the like of which India has not seen in her history\u201d. They waved many flags viz. Soviet flag, Red flag, Russian flag, then League flag. Whenever Dr. SP Mookerjee, a hard-core nationalist, picked up any issue pertaining to the nation\u2019s interest, Reds began howling and yelling from rooftops on top of their voice.\n\nThey ruled over Bengal uninterruptedly for four decades and left the state in tatters, completely pauperized. The State they left behind was infested with anti-national/criminal activities, industrial junkyards, democratic institutions emaciated, education in ruins, then the revelations about electoral malpractices, large-scale booth-capturing, etc. to win elections. They allowed atrocities by Muslims on Hindu-s in the name of secularism, encouraged Bangladeshi infiltrators as their vote-banks destroying entire demography of the State. And when they lost to TMC of Mamata Banerjee, all Reds joined TMC to enjoy a free hand in all matters as ever in addition to a bloodbath of their opponents. In Kerala too, the tale of Reds is almost the same. When they have realized, the ground beneath in Kerala has been slipping away and they are on the verge of decimation, they resorted to uninterrupted killing spree all over the state. Reds in Kerala not only encouraged but also protected missionaries and jihadis in all their nefarious activities.\n\nWherever they have been in power, they deported themselves like monster-killers and when in opposition, they are cunning jackals ever prepared to howl and cry for being the worst victims. They have never been known to undertake any nation-building activity/social work, never in any relief/rehabilitation exercise ever they participated when a natural calamity strikes, never supportive when the nation\u2019s integrity had been at stake or ancient cultural heritage threatened.\n\nIf religion is really opium of masses as vouchsafed by Marx, is not Marxism cyanide pill of the same masses?\n\nAn answer on Quora further details how the Communists and the left-wing are destroying India from within:\n\n&gt;If one examines the reasons of why Communism and Communist parties have been unequivocally rejected the world over. He/She will find that there are solid reasons why the communists countries collapsed, have been hounded in many countries, criticized in several others and violently overthrown in countries which they ruled.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Communism, as an ideology, is in itself so colossally flawed that it cannot be reformed. In the past, all those who have tried to reform its intrinsic faults, either have been labelled as schismatic or have been mass slaughtered for having expressed dissent.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Left has since quite a while ago utilized the term rightist to malign its adversaries, much as the old Christian church called non-Christians \"barbarians\" and \"blasphemers\". Notwithstanding warring Leftist gatherings call their clashing Leftist rivals fascists. European Leftists call the United States a rightist nation. The far Left in America calls the Republican right rightist.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Presently the Soviet Union has vanished from the scene and the Communist development in India does not know whom to serve. In any case, its antagonistic vibe towards Hindu society and culture stays undiminished. It is quite on the cards that this mercenary outfit will be purchased over, at the appointed time, by some other power or powers antagonistic to positive Indian patriotism. A Communist can't resist being a backstabber to his nation and his kin.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Yuri Bezmenov, an ex-KGB agent exposes how the Soviet Union utilized the so called Indian pseudo-intellectuals to obliterate India.** He clarifies how the toxin called communism was acquainted in India to keep alive individuals within the Indian community group who could obliterate our cultural and social values from inside. He goes ahead to clarify the part he played for the Soviet Union. He was to watch and keep an eye on the academicians in India, who were propelled by communist standards, welcome them to Russia and mentally program them into decimating our nation. The Soviet Union essentially implemented a well-arranged procedure to indoctrinate an entire country into their convictions and utilize these countries further bolstering their good fortune.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Clearly thinking about it, this was a splendid arrangement by the Soviet operators. A teacher has the ability to impact the youth who are brimming with vitality. A little provocative direction would clearly lead them to take after communism and supporting standards that the Soviet would need them to.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Bezmenov was directed to gradually however without a doubt build up the Soviet style of authority in India. Around the same time, a sector mandate of the Central Committee opened another secret office in all government offices of the Soviet Union around the globe, titled the \u201cResearch and Counter-Propaganda Group.\u201d Bezmenov turned into a deputy chief of that division, which assembled insight from sources like Indian informers and operators, in regards to practically every compelling or the politically noteworthy subject of India.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Amid that period, progressively observing the Soviet framework as insidious and immoral, Bezmenov cautiously planned to abandon the project.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Now think about this carefully, and you will clearly understand why some universities in India like JNU, Aligarh Muslim University, Jadhavpur University, Hyderabad University, etc. are in this state today.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This video might be somewhat long but is nevertheless extremely critical that you unmistakably understand every single word Yuri says.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[Former KGB Agent Yuri Bezmenov Explains How to Brainwash a Nation (Full Length)](https://youtu.be/5It1zarINv0)  \n&gt;  \n&gt; **The ignominious tale of Indian Communists:**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;West Bengal and Kerala have essentially conceived the brunt of Communist organizations in India. In both these states, the level of influence of the Communist belief system makes it inconceivable for a contradiction to survive. It was essentially in view of this influence the Communist Party clung to control in West Bengal for almost 4 decades. Universities and Colleges were changed over into caves of political thought. Disagreeing students and lecturers/teachers were bashed to death or crashed into depression and despair. Local comrade chieftains caused repulsive reprisal on the individuals who upheld other political gatherings. Kill, Rape, Arson, Electoral deceit all served as weapons to keep up Communist run the show. In Kerala, fight amongst Communists and RSS has guaranteed many lives. Atheist Communists in Kerala bolstered the reason for Mopalastan (Country for Kerala Muslims) and birthed a Muslim larger part region, Malappuram. Atheist Communists in West Bengal have bolstered the reason for illicit migrants from Bangladesh. Communists in India have upheld each hostility to the nation as their own-Independence of Hyderabad, Opposition to Quit India Movement, Partition of India, Support for China in the 1962 war, etc. They have even bolstered the worldwide Jihad as a freeing, anti-Imperialist development on the planet. What's more, now, these godforsaken Leftists have even held hands to contradict Nationalism and patriotism in the nation. Flying the national banner is viewed as a demonstration of incitement, maintaining Indian culture is viewed as an injustice. These Communists and Media people on their finance would preferably have us turned into a province of their Masters than live as glad residents of a free country.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[Census of Political Murders in West Bengal during CPI-M Rule\u20141977-2009](https://www.mainstreamweekly.net/article2234.html)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[From Moscow to Bengal - How Communists dealt with blood](https://www.saddahaq.com/from-moscow-to-bengal-how-communists-dealt-with-blood)\n\nMany conspiracy theories are floating around on the internet which states that communist groups across the world are joining forces to establish what they call as the 'New World Order' in the coming years and nationalism is an inherent setback from accomplishing their goals because of which, the recent cases like that of George Soros to fund 1 Billion USD to fight nationalism is occurring.

Their nefarious activities have not been brought to the fore as the party that ruled over the country for six decades had been in cahoots with Reds, one of the worst instances of anti-national symbiotic relationships.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By deriving maximum advantage from their proximity to the ruling establishment, Reds worked out a powerful/well-hinged network of favor-seekers and favor-providers. This nefarious system had been largely responsible to ensure, the nation remained a wretched leader from the bottom in the merit-list of the UN Human Development Index all these years in all disciplines of national reconstruction. Their drum-beating propagandists/acolytes/adherents resort to fantastic arguments viz. \u201cinevitable to cleanse the system of bourgeoisie /reactionaries\u201d to justify every irrational/anti-national/criminal activity of their unworthiness. Their well-oiled false propaganda-reticulum has tarnished the image of the nation abroad and raised several hurdles in attaining laurels that the nation would have been attained otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The recent instance of Comrade Sitaram Yechury accusing BJP/RSS of \u201cworming their way into Freedom Movement\u201d notwithstanding the facts that they destroyed Gandhi\u2019s Quit India Movement in cahoots with British-Occupiers and always hobnobbed with them, always condemned hard-earned freedom, are yet other stunning pieces of falsehood. They never took up cudgels to discover much to their enlightenment and discomfiture, thousands of RSS members were the foot-soldiers in freedom movement, every RSS shakha individually sent a congratulatory message to JL Nehru when resolution of \u2018Purna Swaraj\u2019 was passed by Congress in 1929, RSS actively participated in Non-Cooperation Movement in 1930, Quit India Movement with the founder Dr. Hedgewar himself very active from Nagpur to Kolkata with Anusilana Samiti and arrested for sedition in May 1921. During trial for sedition, he thundered in court before the Judge, \u201cIndia belongs to Indians. We, therefore, demand independence. This is the content of all my speeches. People have to be told how to secure independence, and also how to conduct themselves after securing it. What law is there that gives one country the right to rule over the other? I am asking you, the Counsel for Government, this simple and straight question. Can you answer it? Is it not that against natural justice? If it is true that no country has a right to rule over another country, who gave the British the authority to trample the people of India under their feet? How can they enslave us and declare that they own this country? Is it not the most blatant murder of justice, morality and Dharma? Our mind revolts at the thought of remaining the slaves of the British Empire and carrying that stigma for all time. We demand nothing short of complete independence. Till we achieve it we cannot be at peace\u2026.\u201d And Communist Reds periodically declare RSS did nothing to attain independence from British-Occupiers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reds are so much obsessed with and fear RSS/Hindu  Rightists that whenever and wherever their political outfit BJP is installed in power, they begin undergoing all sorts of hallucinations hollering from rooftops on top of their vocal cords, be it education, foreign policy, internal security or any issue under the sun. In the state of Tamil Nadu, they have their vernacular version in DMK who keenly follow their footsteps in berating Hindu-s and Hinduism. The latest instances have been suggestions to observe Hindi  Week, Guru-Utsava on Teacher\u2019s Day and substitution of German with Samskrita in Central Schools. When Christians sing \u201cOh Jesus, lead us\u2026\u201d, Reds and Dravidians swing to the tune but turn ferociously abusive if Saraswati Vandana is recited. Red-Wolves just hate anything even remotely connected with Hinduism. Hindi movies run for weeks in Tamil Nadu, Dravidian hotheads produce Hindi-hits and progeny of Mother Tamil send their children to English schools even while abusing Hindi uninterruptedly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Marxist pseudo-historians in cahoots with Nehruvian intellectuals, denigrated all stalwarts of the independence movement, be it Netaji Bose or Sardar Patel. Quite methodically, they established Nehru-Gandhi family as flawless who swear by lofty ideals of democratic values, nourished that through their blood and sweat, others happen to be unworthiness as hangers on to them with a finger in every pie, all achievements of the nation originating from the Dynasty while failures/setbacks crafted by all others. DK Chakravorty, a distinguished historian who taught History / Archaeology at the University of Cambridge, disclosed, \u201cSince coming of this group to power, the world of Indian historical studies has been largely criminalized.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reds have executed cultural subversion of the country extensively so much so that what external invaders could not do, was adroitly committed by them. Reds and westernized rootless, intellectuals know the power and strength of Sanskrit and the fear of being rendered worthless by Sanskrit looms large in their minds. NASA has declared Sanskrit as the perfect language for advanced scientific calculations and computer programming. Briggs wrote in the issue of Artificial Intelligence 1985, \u201cSanskrit is the perfect language designed for enlightened communication. It is the one and only unambiguous spoken language in the world.\u201d All attempts by Red planted bogus western scholars viz. Wendy Doniger, Arundhati Roy, Sheldon Pollock to defame Hindus and Hinduism have been successfully thwarted so far by a determined group of nationalists whom Reds do not miss even whiff of an opportunity to berate and abuse. Reds do not allow people to believe that the great Hindu civilization adored women, that there were no Dalits /untouchables, that there were no prostitutes at all, that it was an invasion of western bigots that destroyed Hindu civilization and cultural heritage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So desperate were they after installation of Modi government in 2014 that they not only engineered murderous assaults on so-called rationalists, the farcical return of awards by literary figures, etc. but also raised the decibel level between two lunatic fringes of society, one faking public opinion and the other, symptomatic of Government policies. They even moved to the extent of declaring; the Idea of India is in a perpetual clash with the Govt. elected with a massive mandate to deliver the Idea of India. It is always that Leftist intellectuals cry wolf loudest. They dread the scenario of losing control of the Indian Council of Historical Research which they monopolize to carry out their nefarious designs of cultural/historical subversions. \u2018Eminent Historians\u2019 authored by Arun Shourie speaks volumes on their \u2018trade\u2019 practices solely meant to perpetuate Red hegemony. Red historian Irfan Habib even went to the extent of castigating revival efforts of the Saraswati river which enjoys enormous value in Vedic wisdom and Hindu civilization. The Marxist historian spent his lifetime proving, the Saraswati river never existed, contrary to all scientific studies, satellite imagery, etc. to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fraudulent theory of Aryan Invasion too was propagated Marxists. Also are they hell-bent to negate everything even remotely connected with Sanatana Dharma? Everything good about Hinduism, if at all any, was brought in by Aryan invaders, Alexander brought Vedic wisdom into the country\u2026and Hindus at best, be remembered for having contributed absolutely nothing. The first activity that Marxists undertake is to destroy entire cultural heritage and convert everyone into empty-headed zombies to create space in their minds so as to allow the venomous doctrine of Marxism to take roots in their minds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reds deviously supported Jinnah\u2019s Direct Action on Aug.16, 1946 and partition of Bharat with the statement in their own words, \u201c\u2026secession would lead to still greater and more glorious unity of India, the like of which India has not seen in her history\u201d. They waved many flags viz. Soviet flag, Red flag, Russian flag, then League flag. Whenever Dr. SP Mookerjee, a hard-core nationalist, picked up any issue pertaining to the nation\u2019s interest, Reds began howling and yelling from rooftops on top of their voice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They ruled over Bengal uninterruptedly for four decades and left the state in tatters, completely pauperized. The State they left behind was infested with anti-national/criminal activities, industrial junkyards, democratic institutions emaciated, education in ruins, then the revelations about electoral malpractices, large-scale booth-capturing, etc. to win elections. They allowed atrocities by Muslims on Hindu-s in the name of secularism, encouraged Bangladeshi infiltrators as their vote-banks destroying entire demography of the State. And when they lost to TMC of Mamata Banerjee, all Reds joined TMC to enjoy a free hand in all matters as ever in addition to a bloodbath of their opponents. In Kerala too, the tale of Reds is almost the same. When they have realized, the ground beneath in Kerala has been slipping away and they are on the verge of decimation, they resorted to uninterrupted killing spree all over the state. Reds in Kerala not only encouraged but also protected missionaries and jihadis in all their nefarious activities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wherever they have been in power, they deported themselves like monster-killers and when in opposition, they are cunning jackals ever prepared to howl and cry for being the worst victims. They have never been known to undertake any nation-building activity/social work, never in any relief/rehabilitation exercise ever they participated when a natural calamity strikes, never supportive when the nation\u2019s integrity had been at stake or ancient cultural heritage threatened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If religion is really opium of masses as vouchsafed by Marx, is not Marxism cyanide pill of the same masses?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An answer on Quora further details how the Communists and the left-wing are destroying India from within:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If one examines the reasons of why Communism and Communist parties have been unequivocally rejected the world over. He/She will find that there are solid reasons why the communists countries collapsed, have been hounded in many countries, criticized in several others and violently overthrown in countries which they ruled.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Communism, as an ideology, is in itself so colossally flawed that it cannot be reformed. In the past, all those who have tried to reform its intrinsic faults, either have been labelled as schismatic or have been mass slaughtered for having expressed dissent.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Left has since quite a while ago utilized the term rightist to malign its adversaries, much as the old Christian church called non-Christians &amp;quot;barbarians&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;blasphemers&amp;quot;. Notwithstanding warring Leftist gatherings call their clashing Leftist rivals fascists. European Leftists call the United States a rightist nation. The far Left in America calls the Republican right rightist.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Presently the Soviet Union has vanished from the scene and the Communist development in India does not know whom to serve. In any case, its antagonistic vibe towards Hindu society and culture stays undiminished. It is quite on the cards that this mercenary outfit will be purchased over, at the appointed time, by some other power or powers antagonistic to positive Indian patriotism. A Communist can&amp;#39;t resist being a backstabber to his nation and his kin.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yuri Bezmenov, an ex-KGB agent exposes how the Soviet Union utilized the so called Indian pseudo-intellectuals to obliterate India.&lt;/strong&gt; He clarifies how the toxin called communism was acquainted in India to keep alive individuals within the Indian community group who could obliterate our cultural and social values from inside. He goes ahead to clarify the part he played for the Soviet Union. He was to watch and keep an eye on the academicians in India, who were propelled by communist standards, welcome them to Russia and mentally program them into decimating our nation. The Soviet Union essentially implemented a well-arranged procedure to indoctrinate an entire country into their convictions and utilize these countries further bolstering their good fortune.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Clearly thinking about it, this was a splendid arrangement by the Soviet operators. A teacher has the ability to impact the youth who are brimming with vitality. A little provocative direction would clearly lead them to take after communism and supporting standards that the Soviet would need them to.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bezmenov was directed to gradually however without a doubt build up the Soviet style of authority in India. Around the same time, a sector mandate of the Central Committee opened another secret office in all government offices of the Soviet Union around the globe, titled the \u201cResearch and Counter-Propaganda Group.\u201d Bezmenov turned into a deputy chief of that division, which assembled insight from sources like Indian informers and operators, in regards to practically every compelling or the politically noteworthy subject of India.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Amid that period, progressively observing the Soviet framework as insidious and immoral, Bezmenov cautiously planned to abandon the project.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now think about this carefully, and you will clearly understand why some universities in India like JNU, Aligarh Muslim University, Jadhavpur University, Hyderabad University, etc. are in this state today.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This video might be somewhat long but is nevertheless extremely critical that you unmistakably understand every single word Yuri says.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/5It1zarINv0\"&gt;Former KGB Agent Yuri Bezmenov Explains How to Brainwash a Nation (Full Length)&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ignominious tale of Indian Communists:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;West Bengal and Kerala have essentially conceived the brunt of Communist organizations in India. In both these states, the level of influence of the Communist belief system makes it inconceivable for a contradiction to survive. It was essentially in view of this influence the Communist Party clung to control in West Bengal for almost 4 decades. Universities and Colleges were changed over into caves of political thought. Disagreeing students and lecturers/teachers were bashed to death or crashed into depression and despair. Local comrade chieftains caused repulsive reprisal on the individuals who upheld other political gatherings. Kill, Rape, Arson, Electoral deceit all served as weapons to keep up Communist run the show. In Kerala, fight amongst Communists and RSS has guaranteed many lives. Atheist Communists in Kerala bolstered the reason for Mopalastan (Country for Kerala Muslims) and birthed a Muslim larger part region, Malappuram. Atheist Communists in West Bengal have bolstered the reason for illicit migrants from Bangladesh. Communists in India have upheld each hostility to the nation as their own-Independence of Hyderabad, Opposition to Quit India Movement, Partition of India, Support for China in the 1962 war, etc. They have even bolstered the worldwide Jihad as a freeing, anti-Imperialist development on the planet. What&amp;#39;s more, now, these godforsaken Leftists have even held hands to contradict Nationalism and patriotism in the nation. Flying the national banner is viewed as a demonstration of incitement, maintaining Indian culture is viewed as an injustice. These Communists and Media people on their finance would preferably have us turned into a province of their Masters than live as glad residents of a free country.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.mainstreamweekly.net/article2234.html\"&gt;Census of Political Murders in West Bengal during CPI-M Rule\u20141977-2009&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.saddahaq.com/from-moscow-to-bengal-how-communists-dealt-with-blood\"&gt;From Moscow to Bengal - How Communists dealt with blood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many conspiracy theories are floating around on the internet which states that communist groups across the world are joining forces to establish what they call as the &amp;#39;New World Order&amp;#39; in the coming years and nationalism is an inherent setback from accomplishing their goals because of which, the recent cases like that of George Soros to fund 1 Billion USD to fight nationalism is occurring. What are your thoughts on this? Let me know in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

     "selftext": "The world is all ears to the sob stories of Muslims. There is sympathy for their plight, there are worldwide protests and rampant Hinduphobia in the media if their interests are even slightly threatened and oftentimes, its the Muslims who are suffering the retribution over something which they instigated in the first place and then the blame game begins and the Hindus are held accountable for retaliation and being intolerant to the atrocious nature of this so called 'peaceful minority'.\n\nThe genocide suffered by the Hindus of India at the hands of Arab, Turkish, Mughal and Afghan occupying forces for a period of 800 years is as yet formally unrecognized by the world.\n\nWith the invasion of India by Mahmud Ghazni about 1000 A.D., began the Muslim invasions into the Indian subcontinent and they lasted for several centuries. Nadir Shah made a mountain of the skulls of the Hindus he killed in Delhi alone. Babur raised towers of Hindu skulls at Khanua when he defeated Rana Sanga in 1527 and later he repeated the same horrors after capturing the fort of Chanderi. Akbar ordered a general massacre of 30,000 Rajputs after he captured Chittorgarh in 1568. The Bahamani Sultans had an annual agenda of killing a minimum of 100,000 Hindus every year.\n\nThe history of medieval India is full of such instances. The holocaust of the Hindus in India continued for 800 years, till the brutal regimes were effectively overpowered in a life and death struggle by the Sikhs in Punjab and the Hindu Maratha armies in other parts of India in the late 1700\u2019s.\n\nWe have elaborate literary evidence of the world\u2019s biggest holocaust from existing historical contemporary eyewitness accounts. The historians and biographers of the invading armies and subsequent rulers of India have left quite detailed records of the atrocities they committed in their day-to-day encounters with India\u2019s Hindus.\n\nThese contemporary records boasted about and glorified the crimes that were committed and the genocide of tens of millions of Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains, mass rapes of women and the destruction of thousands of ancient Hindu/Buddhist temples and libraries have been well documented and provide solid proof of the world\u2019s biggest holocaust.\n\n**Quotes from modern historians**\n\nDr. Koenraad Elst in his article \u201cWas There an Islamic Genocide of Hindus?\u201d states:\n\n\u201cThere is no official estimate of the total death toll of Hindus at the hands of Islam. A first glance at important testimonies by Muslim chroniclers suggests that over 13 centuries and a territory as vast as the subcontinent, Muslim holy warriors easily killed more Hindus than the 6 million of the holocaust. Ferishtha lists several occasions when the Bahmani sultans in central India (1347-1528) killed a hundred thousand Hindus, which they set as a minimum goal whenever they felt like punishing the Hindus; and they were only a third-rank provincial dynasty.\n\nThe biggest slaughters took place during the raids of Mahmud Ghaznavi (ca. 1000 CE) during the actual conquest of North India by Mohammed Ghori and his lieutenants (1192 ff.) and under the Delhi Sultanate (1206-1526).\u201c\n\nHe also writes in his book \u201cNegation in India\u201d:\n\n\u201cThe Muslim conquests, down to the 16th century, were for the Hindus a pure struggle of life and death. Entire cities were burnt down and the populations massacred, with hundreds of thousands killed in every campaign, and similar numbers deported as slaves. Every new invader made (often literally) his hills of Hindus skulls. Thus, the conquest of Afghanistan in the year 1000 was followed by the annihilation of the Hindu population; the region is still called the Hindu Kush, i.e. Hindu slaughter.\u201d\n\nWill Durant argued in his 1935 book \u201cThe Story of Civilisation: Our Oriental Heritage\u201d (page 459):\n\n\u201cThe Mohammedan conquest of India is probably the bloodiest story in history. The Islamic historians and scholars have recorded with great glee and pride the slaughters of Hindus, forced conversions, abduction of Hindu women and children to slave markets and the destruction of temples carried out by the warriors of Islam during 800 AD to 1700 AD. Millions of Hindus were converted to Islam by sword during this period.\u201d\n\nFrancois Gautier in his book \u2018Rewriting Indian History\u2019 (1996) wrote:\n\n\u201cThe massacres perpetuated by Muslims in India are unparalleled in history, bigger than the holocaust of the Jews by the Nazis, or the massacre of the Armenians by the Turks, more extensive even than the slaughter of the South American native populations by the invading Spanish and Portuguese.\u201d\n\nAlain Danielou in his book, Histoire de l\u2019 Inde writes:\n\n\u201cFrom the time Muslims started arriving, around 632 AD, the history of India becomes a long, monotonous series of murders, massacres, spoliations, and destructions. It is, as usual, in the name of \u2018a holy war\u2019 of their faith, of their sole God, that the barbarians have destroyed civilizations, wiped out entire races.\u201d\n\nIrfan Husain in his article \u201cDemons from the Past\u201d observes:\n\n\u201cWhile historical events should be judged in the context of their times, it cannot be denied that even in that bloody period of history, no mercy was shown to the Hindus unfortunate enough to be in the path of either the Arab conquerors of Sindh and south Punjab or the Central Asians who swept in from Afghanistan. The Muslim heroes who figure larger than life in our history books committed some dreadful crimes. Mahmud of Ghazni, Qutb-ud-Din Aibak, Balban, Mohammed bin Qasim, and Sultan Mohammad Tughlak, all have blood-stained hands that the passage of years has not cleansed. Seen through Hindu eyes, the Muslim invasion of their homeland was an unmitigated disaster.\n\n\u201cTheir temples were razed, their idols smashed, their women raped, their men killed or taken slaves. When Mahmud of Ghazni entered Somnath on one of his annual raids, he slaughtered all 50,000 inhabitants. Aibak killed and enslaved hundreds of thousands. The list of horrors is long and painful. These conquerors justified their deeds by claiming it was their religious duty to smite non-believers. Cloaking themselves in the banner of Islam, they claimed they were fighting for their faith when, in reality, they were indulging in straightforward slaughter and pillage\u2026\u201d\n\nA sample of contemporary eyewitness accounts of the invaders and rulers, during the Indian conquests\n\nThe Afghan ruler Mahmud al-Ghazni invaded India no less than seventeen times between 1001 \u2013 1026 AD. The book \u2018Tarikh-i-Yamini\u2019 \u2013 written by his secretary documents several episodes of his bloody military campaigns: \u201cThe blood of the infidels flowed so copiously at the Indian city of Thanesar that the stream was discolored, notwithstanding its purity, and people were unable to drink it. The infidels deserted the fort and tried to cross the foaming river but many of them were slain, taken or drowned. Nearly fifty thousand men were killed.\u201d\n\nIn the contemporary record \u2013 \u2018 Taj-ul-Ma\u2019asir\u2019 by Hassn Nizam-i-Naishapuri, it is stated that when Qutb-ul- Din Aibak (of Turko \u2013 Afghan origin and the First Sultan of Delhi 1194 \u2013 1210 AD) conquered Meerut, he demolished all the Hindu temples of the city and erected mosques on their sites. In the city of Aligarh, he converted Hindu inhabitants to Islam by the sword and beheaded all those who adhered to their own religion.\n\nThe Persian historian Wassaf writes in his book \u2018Tazjiyat-ul-Amsar wa Tajriyat ul Asar\u2019 that when the Alaul-Din Khilji (an Afghan of Turkish origin and second ruler of the Khilji Dynasty in India 1295-1316 AD) captured the city of Kambayat at the head of the Gulf of Cambay, he killed the adult male Hindu inhabitants for the glory of Islam, set flowing rivers of blood, sent the women of the country with all their gold, silver, and jewels, to his own home, and made about twenty thousand Hindu maidens his private slaves.\n\nThis ruler once asked his spiritual advisor (or \u2018Qazi\u2019) as to what was the Islamic law prescribed for the Hindus. The Qazi replied:\n\n*\u201cHindus are like the mud, if silver is demanded from them, they must with the greatest humility offer gold. If a Mohammadan desires to spit into a Hindu\u2019s mouth, the Hindu should open it wide for the purpose. God created the Hindus to be slaves of the Mohammadans. The Prophet hath ordained that, if the Hindus do not accept Islam, they should be imprisoned, tortured, finally put to death, and their property confiscated.\u201d*\n\nTimur was a Turkic conqueror and founder of the Timurid Dynasty. Timur\u2019s Indian campaign (1398 \u2013 1399 AD) was recorded in his memoirs, collectively known as \u2018Tuzk-i-Timuri.\u2019 In them, he vividly described probably the greatest gruesome act in the entire history of the world \u2013 where 100,000 Hindu prisoners of war in his camp were executed in a very short space of time. Timur after taking advice from his entourage says in his memoirs :\n\n*\u201cthey said that on the great day of battle these 100,000 prisoners could not be left with the baggage and that it would be entirely opposed to the rules of war to set these idolaters and foes of Islam at liberty.\"*\n\n*\u201cIn fact, no other course remained but that of making them all food for the sword\"*\n\nTimur thereupon resolved to put them to death. He proclaimed :\n\n*\u201cthroughout the camp that every man who has infidel prisoners was to put them to death, and whoever neglected to do so should himself be executed and his property given to the informer. When this order became known to the ghazis of Islam, they drew their swords and put their prisoners to death. 100,000 infidels, impious idolaters, were on that day slain. Maulana Nasir-ud-din Umar, a counselor and a man of learning, who, in all his life had never killed a sparrow, now, in execution of my order, slew with his sword fifteen idolatrous Hindus, who were his captives\u201c.*\n\nDuring his campaign in India \u2013 Timur describes the scene when his army conquered the Indian city of Delhi :\n\n*\u201cIn a short space of time all the people in the Delhi fort were put to the sword, and in the course of one hour, the heads of 10,000 infidels were cut off. The sword of Islam was washed in the blood of the infidels, and all the goods and effects, the treasure and the grain which for many a long year had been stored in the fort became the spoil of my soldiers.*\n\n*\u201cThey set fire to the houses and reduced them to ashes, and they razed the buildings and the fort to the ground. All these infidel Hindus were slain, their women and children, and their property and goods became the spoil of the victors. I proclaimed throughout the camp that every man who had infidel prisoners should put them to death, and whoever neglected to do so should himself be executed and his property given to the informer. When this order became known to the ghazis of Islam, they drew their swords and put their prisoners to death.\u201d*\n\nThe Mughal emperor Babur (who ruled India from 1526 -1530 AD) writing in his memoirs called the \u2018Baburnama\u2019 \u2013 wrote: \u201d In AH 934 (2538 C.E.) I attacked Chanderi and by the grace of Allah captured it in a few hours. We got the infidels slaughtered and the place which had been Daru\u2019l-Harb (nation of non-muslims) for years was made into a Daru\u2019l-Islam (a Muslim nation).\u201d\n\nIn Babur\u2019s own words in a poem about killing Hindus (From the \u2018Baburnama\u2019 ), he wrote :\n\n*\u201cFor the sake of Islam, I became a wanderer, I battled infidels and Hindus, I determined to become a martyr. Thank God I became a killer of Non-Muslims!\u201d*\n\nThe atrocities of the Mughal ruler Shah Jahan (who ruled India between 1628 \u2013 1658 AD) are mentioned in the contemporary record called: \u2018Badshah Nama, Qazinivi &amp; Badshah Nama, Lahori\u2019 and goes on to state: \u201cWhen Shuja was appointed as governor of Kabul he carried on a ruthless war in the Hindu territory beyond Indus\u2026The sword of Islam yielded a rich crop of converts. Most of the women (to save their honor) burnt themselves to death. Those captured were distributed among Muslim Mansabdars (Noblemen)\u201d\n\nThe Afghan ruler Ahmad Shah Abdali attacked India in 1757 AD and made his way to the holy Hindu city of Mathura, the Bethlehem of the Hindus and birthplace of Krishna.\n\nThe atrocities that followed are recorded in the contemporary chronicle called: \u2018Tarikh-I-Alamgiri\u2019 :\n\n*\u201cAbdali\u2019s soldiers would be paid 5 Rupees (a sizeable amount at the time) for every enemy head brought in. Every horseman had loaded up all his horses with the plundered property, and atop of it rode the girl-captives and the slaves. The severed heads were tied up in rugs like bundles of grain and placed on the heads of the captives. Then the heads were stuck upon lances and taken to the gate of the chief minister for payment.*\n\n*\u201cIt was an extraordinary display! Daily did this manner of slaughter and plundering proceed. And at night the shrieks of the women captives who were being raped deafened the ears of the people. All those heads that had been cut off were built into pillars, and the captive men upon whose heads those bloody bundles had been brought in, were made to grind corn, and then their heads too were cut off. These things went on all the way to the city of Agra, nor was any part of the country spared.\u201d*\n\nBanda Singh Bahadur was tortured to death after being imprisoned for 3 months. The heart of Banda Singh\u2019s son was put in his mouth in an attempt to humiliate him\n\nWhy we should remember?\n\nThe biggest holocaust in world history has been whitewashed from history.\n\nWhen we hear the word 'holocaust', most of us think immediately of the Jewish holocaust. Today, with increased awareness and countless cinema films and television documentaries, many of us are also aware of the holocaust of the Native American people, the genocide of the Armenian people in the Ottoman Empire, and the millions of African lives lost during the Atlantic slave trade.\n\nEurope and America produced at least a few thousand films highlighting the human misery caused by Hitler and his army. The films expose the horrors of the Nazi regime and reinforce the beliefs and attitude of the present day generation towards the evils of the Nazi dictatorship.\n\nIn contrast, look at India. There is hardly any awareness among the Indians of today of what happened to their ancestors in the past because a great majority of historians are reluctant to touch this sensitive subject.\n\n**The world seems to either ignore or just does not seem to care about the many millions of lives lost during the 800 years long holocaust of Hindus, Sikhs, and Buddhists in India.**\n\nThe Indian historian Professor K.S. Lal estimates that the Hindu population in India decreased by 80 million between 1000 AD and 1525 AD, an extermination unparalleled in world history. This slaughter of millions of people occurred over regular periods during many centuries of Arab, Afghan, Turkish and Mughal rule in India.\n\nMany Indian heroes emerged during these dark times, including the 10th Sikh Guru \u2013 Guru Gobind Singh and also the Hindu Maratha king \u2013 Shivaji Maharaj, who led the resistance against this tyranny and eventually led to its defeat by the late 1700s after centuries of death and destruction.\n\nThe modern world today is facing a global threat from organizations and groups of terrorists such as ISIS, Taliban, and Al-Qaeda whose ideology is chillingly similar to that of the perpetrators of the world\u2019s biggest holocaust in India.\n\nLet us hope that the bloody lessons of the past are learned so that history does not even have the remotest chance of repeating itself.\n\nNever forgive. Never forget. Rise up.",

All those heads that had been cut off were built into pillars, and the captive men upon whose heads those bloody bundles had been brought in, were made to grind corn, and then their heads too were cut off. These things went on all the way to the city of Agra, nor was any part of the country spared.\u201d&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Banda Singh Bahadur was tortured to death after being imprisoned for 3 months. The heart of Banda Singh\u2019s son was put in his mouth in an attempt to humiliate him&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why we should remember?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The biggest holocaust in world history has been whitewashed from history.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we hear the word &amp;#39;holocaust&amp;#39;, most of us think immediately of the Jewish holocaust. Today, with increased awareness and countless cinema films and television documentaries, many of us are also aware of the holocaust of the Native American people, the genocide of the Armenian people in the Ottoman Empire, and the millions of African lives lost during the Atlantic slave trade.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Europe and America produced at least a few thousand films highlighting the human misery caused by Hitler and his army. The films expose the horrors of the Nazi regime and reinforce the beliefs and attitude of the present day generation towards the evils of the Nazi dictatorship.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In contrast, look at India. There is hardly any awareness among the Indians of today of what happened to their ancestors in the past because a great majority of historians are reluctant to touch this sensitive subject.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The world seems to either ignore or just does not seem to care about the many millions of lives lost during the 800 years long holocaust of Hindus, Sikhs, and Buddhists in India.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Indian historian Professor K.S. Lal estimates that the Hindu population in India decreased by 80 million between 1000 AD and 1525 AD, an extermination unparalleled in world history. This slaughter of millions of people occurred over regular periods during many centuries of Arab, Afghan, Turkish and Mughal rule in India.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many Indian heroes emerged during these dark times, including the 10th Sikh Guru \u2013 Guru Gobind Singh and also the Hindu Maratha king \u2013 Shivaji Maharaj, who led the resistance against this tyranny and eventually led to its defeat by the late 1700s after centuries of death and destruction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The modern world today is facing a global threat from organizations and groups of terrorists such as ISIS, Taliban, and Al-Qaeda whose ideology is chillingly similar to that of the perpetrators of the world\u2019s biggest holocaust in India.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let us hope that the bloody lessons of the past are learned so that history does not even have the remotest chance of repeating itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Never forgive. Never forget. Rise up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

     "selftext": "This post will attempt to analyze Godse's actions and reach a possible conclusion from his statement. If you haven't already read the [part-I](https://np.reddit.com/r/HindutvaRises/comments/ephmyc/why_i_killed_gandhi_parti_nathuram_godses_final/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x), go read it now.\n\n\u201cHistory is always written by the winners. When two cultures clash, the loser is obliterated, and the winner writes the history books-books which glorify their own cause and disparage the conquered foe. As Napoleon once said, 'What is history, but a fable agreed upon?\"\n\nNathuram Godse, the assassin of Gandhi did not get a chance to write an autobiography. But he spoke for himself at the court of law.\n\nGodse gave a detailed explanation for his act of assassination of Gandhi during his high-profile trial held at the Red Fort in Delhi. The statement, however, was kept away from the public by the hegemony of the Indian National Congress. Gopal Godse, Nathuram\u2019s younger brother later published it as an underground text under the title *Why I assassinated Gandhi*.\n\nLet's highlight a few points in the present context:\n\nGodse assassinated Gandhi. Assassination has a different context than simple murder or homicide. The Indian Penal Code does not differentiate between the two. 'Assassination' is generally taken to refer to a political killing. Since he was a committed Hindu, his beliefs are shaped by the fact that Ram had to kill Ravan to liberate Lanka of evil, Arjun had, in fact, fought the war after the revelation of Krishna himself. Godse and many like him believe that violence is a divine tool for fighting anything that is evil, according to them.\n\nGodse was not a mass murderer. He murdered one man and surrendered then and there. He further requested the court not to show any mercy at him while reading out his statement. However, as per Godse, Gandhi was a mass murderer. He accused Gandhi of being pro-Muslim and anti-Hindu in his political activities and positions. According to Godse, if Gandhi was not at the helm of Indian politics during the freedom struggle and thereafter, partition, the resultant bloodbath could have been avoided.\n\nGandhi claimed that his final fasting days were for Hindu-Muslim unity. After partition, Pakistan was due to get an amount of Rs 55 crore from the imperial treasury as part of the deal. But Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel held it up from his end until the Kashmir issue was solved. Godse accused Gandhi of blackmailing the Indian government using his fasts and interfering in state affairs. Godse alleged that it was not only undemocratic but dictatorial in the sense that Gandhi's own understanding had to prevail no matter what. This action made India weak at bargaining on Kashmir. Gandhi strictly practiced and imposed non-violence on everyone. If the Indian National Congress and its leaders digressed he would start a fast unto death. The demands had to be complied with. His personal ideology at times harmed the country\u2019s interests.\n\nGodse believed that Gandhi was supporting unreasonable Muslim's interests at the cost of the Hindus.\n\nFirst, it was the demand for Pakistan which he accepted. On 15 August 1947, Pakistan was established deceitfully. No thought was given to the Hindus of Punjab, Bengal and other states across the border. The country was broken into pieces and a nation was formed just on the basis of religion. Muslims got the fruit of their anti-national seeds in the form of Pakistan. Gandhivadis called those people anti-nationals and communal who were against Pakistan and themselves accepted Pakistan and agreed to all the conditions of Jinnah. All the Muslims were granted full security in India and had the choice to stay back if they wanted. As a result, many Muslims never went to Pakistan and the very purpose of creating a new nation, for them was defeated. Unlike in India, the Hindus in Pakistan were forced to leave the country. Men, women, and children were brutalized. One million people died. Gandhi's ideology of non-violence actually led to lots of violence.\n\nAfter the creation of Pakistan, if the Congress government had done something for the protection of Hindus in Pakistan, then his anger would have decreased. He couldn't see the betrayal of his own people. Crores of Hindus were left on the mercy of Muslims and Gandhi promoted the idea that Hindus should not come to India and should remain in Pakistan. This way Hindus were trapped in the clutter of Muslims and became prey to the calamities there. Thousands of Hindus were killed every day, 15 Lakh Sikhs were brutally murdered on the gunpoint. Hindu women were taken out for processions, nude. They were sold just like animals. Lakhs of Hindus had to save their religion and run. He was furious that empty mosques housing Hindu refugees in Delhi were vacated on Gandhi\u2019s insistence so that they could be occupied by Muslim refugees. In the cold winters, the Hindu refugees had nowhere to go. A request similar to that of mosques was not made for temples in Pakistan. On the other hand temples in Pakistan were defiled. If the Indian government had pressurized the Pakistan government or warned them of a similar treatment to Muslims in India then probably this situation would not have come. But they did nothing to save the Hindu community there. Godse was full of grouse, that Gandhi and the Congress never exerted diplomatic pressure on Pakistan for the safeguard of its people or threatened to retaliate.\n\nIndian government ran on the ideals of Gandhi and if a newspaper wrote something about the conditions of Hindus there, they were considered as the creators of tensions among the two groups. A Hindu activist Ganesh Shankar Vidhyarthi was brutally murdered by a Muslim mob. Gandhi wanted everyone to give up their life for India\u2019s freedom, but fighting non violently. He did not condemn the violent action of the Muslims. He was never for retaliation but suffering quietly. Similarly, the men of the Nizam of Hyderabad carried out excesses on the Hindu brethren. But all Gandhi did was appease the Nizam and requested him to give up his state and join the confederation of independent states. The Nizam never ceded ground. He significantly pointed out that after Gandhi's death, the Indian government sent, armed forces to Hyderabad and defeated the Nizam. Hyderabad too became a part of Independent India. Gandhi with his philosophy of non-violence would have never allowed it.\n\nHe finally decided to eliminate Gandhi by assassination when he sat for his final *satyagraha.* Godse said that he assassinated Gandhi so that his people, the Hindus do not suffer injustice. He touched the feet of Gandhi before killing. In court, he said that Gandhi and his principles were great and perhaps a man like him will never reborn. So out of respect for Gandhi, he touched Gandhi's feet before killing. But because no man is more important or bigger than the nation, to protect the nation he had to both, sacrifice his life and kill Gandhi as well. He knew that after killing Gandhi he will be caught and hanged, but it was a necessity of that time. Godse also sacrificed his own life for killing Gandhi. He paid the price of killing Gandhi by being prosecuted and getting hanged. He became infamous, however, he protected Hindus from the immature decisions of Gandhi. He said I could have poisoned Gandhi or killed him in a way that it looks like a natural death but I chose to kill him with bullets, so I can tell the world, the truth that would never come out otherwise. He became a notorious person after killing Gandhi but, he did this to protect his loving motherland and Hindu brothers &amp; sisters, from the wrath of cruel Islamic atrocities.\n\nGodse considered Gandhi to be a hypocrite at statecraft and his method of *satyagraha* a total failure in practical terms. Gandhi should be acknowledged for his deep study of Indian philosophy and relating it to the 20th Century social context and also leading a very innovative movement. *Ahimsa* is an ancient idea propagated by Buddhism for ages. But Gandhi was a barrister at British law. He loved it. He was not a saint trying to be a politician, but a politician trying to be a saint. His method of non-violent yet unconstitutional resistance was the result of deep study and integration of both Indian philosophies as well as British law. The British Raj in India was proud of its hegemonic rule of law, which was a first for India in almost 3,000 years of its history. To fight against such a rule, neither armed resistance nor constitutional dialogue worked. Gandhi chose the middle path and shook the entire establishment. But this was only possible when both parties respected the rule of law.\n\nIn 1947, Pakistan sent invaders into Kashmir to forcefully integrate it with Pakistan. Godse had one question regarding this. Since Gandhi believed so deeply in *satyagraha*, why did he agree with Jawaharlal Nehru and Patel when it came to sending the army to Kashmir? Why did he not send a group of *satyagrahis* to fast before the invaders and change their behavior? This point questions the ideology of *satyagraha* altogether. From a position of power, *satyagraha* does not possibly work, it seems.\n\nLet's address the issue - Patriotism. A dictionary definition suggests it is \"the feeling of loving your country more than any others and being proud of it\". There is no doubt that right-wing nationalists like Godse loved India.\n\nIf violence delegitimizes one's patriotism, then why do we have an India Gate and a National War Memorial at all? All soldiers are professional killers. Godse considered Gandhi an enemy of the state, so he killed him. One can question his politics as well as his problematic social positions, but cannot question his patriotism on the basis of a political murder. Also, Gandhi advocated non-violence. But that does not make the use of violence obsolete. India has fought six wars with its neighboring countries and commands one of the largest armies in the world.\n\nFinally, let us understand the Mahatma \u2014 the father of the nation. We have made a god out of a man in Gandhi. Historian Bipan Chandra in his popular book *India's struggle for freedom*\u00a0refers to all top leaders of freedom struggle by name (Nehru, Patel, etc.) But, when it comes to Gandhi, he refers to him as Gandhi*ji*. Gandhi was made a Mahatma slowly and gradually after his death. There were many in opposition among his contemporaries and tallest among them were Subhas Chandra Bose and Dr. BR Ambedkar.\n\nThe back cover of\u00a0*Why I assassinated Gandhi* quotes Justice Khosla, \"The audience was visibly and audibly moved. There was a deep silence when he (Godse) ceased speaking.\" This silence has been strategically maintained by academics till date. Godse has been named a terrorist, a murderer, an anti-national, and whatnot. One must read about Godse before creating a love or hate campaign in his name.",

He became a notorious person after killing Gandhi but, he did this to protect his loving motherland and Hindu brothers &amp;amp; sisters, from the wrath of cruel Islamic atrocities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Godse considered Gandhi to be a hypocrite at statecraft and his method of &lt;em&gt;satyagraha&lt;/em&gt; a total failure in practical terms. Gandhi should be acknowledged for his deep study of Indian philosophy and relating it to the 20th Century social context and also leading a very innovative movement. &lt;em&gt;Ahimsa&lt;/em&gt; is an ancient idea propagated by Buddhism for ages. But Gandhi was a barrister at British law. He loved it. He was not a saint trying to be a politician, but a politician trying to be a saint. His method of non-violent yet unconstitutional resistance was the result of deep study and integration of both Indian philosophies as well as British law. The British Raj in India was proud of its hegemonic rule of law, which was a first for India in almost 3,000 years of its history. To fight against such a rule, neither armed resistance nor constitutional dialogue worked. Gandhi chose the middle path and shook the entire establishment. But this was only possible when both parties respected the rule of law.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 1947, Pakistan sent invaders into Kashmir to forcefully integrate it with Pakistan. Godse had one question regarding this. Since Gandhi believed so deeply in &lt;em&gt;satyagraha&lt;/em&gt;, why did he agree with Jawaharlal Nehru and Patel when it came to sending the army to Kashmir? Why did he not send a group of &lt;em&gt;satyagrahis&lt;/em&gt; to fast before the invaders and change their behavior? This point questions the ideology of &lt;em&gt;satyagraha&lt;/em&gt; altogether. From a position of power, &lt;em&gt;satyagraha&lt;/em&gt; does not possibly work, it seems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s address the issue - Patriotism. A dictionary definition suggests it is &amp;quot;the feeling of loving your country more than any others and being proud of it&amp;quot;. There is no doubt that right-wing nationalists like Godse loved India.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If violence delegitimizes one&amp;#39;s patriotism, then why do we have an India Gate and a National War Memorial at all? All soldiers are professional killers. Godse considered Gandhi an enemy of the state, so he killed him. One can question his politics as well as his problematic social positions, but cannot question his patriotism on the basis of a political murder. Also, Gandhi advocated non-violence. But that does not make the use of violence obsolete. India has fought six wars with its neighboring countries and commands one of the largest armies in the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, let us understand the Mahatma \u2014 the father of the nation. We have made a god out of a man in Gandhi. Historian Bipan Chandra in his popular book &lt;em&gt;India&amp;#39;s struggle for freedom&lt;/em&gt;\u00a0refers to all top leaders of freedom struggle by name (Nehru, Patel, etc.) But, when it comes to Gandhi, he refers to him as Gandhi&lt;em&gt;ji&lt;/em&gt;. Gandhi was made a Mahatma slowly and gradually after his death. There were many in opposition among his contemporaries and tallest among them were Subhas Chandra Bose and Dr. BR Ambedkar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The back cover of\u00a0&lt;em&gt;Why I assassinated Gandhi&lt;/em&gt; quotes Justice Khosla, &amp;quot;The audience was visibly and audibly moved. There was a deep silence when he (Godse) ceased speaking.&amp;quot; This silence has been strategically maintained by academics till date. Godse has been named a terrorist, a murderer, an anti-national, and whatnot. One must read about Godse before creating a love or hate campaign in his name.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

     "selftext": "This is a two part post, of which the part-I comprises of Nathuram Godse's final statement detailing why he decided to assassinate Gandhi. The part-II will attempt to analyze Godse's actions from a neutral perspective.\n\n\nNathuram Godse assassinated Gandhiji on 30 January 1948. The trial began on 27 May 1948 and concluded on 10 February 1949. He was sentenced to death.\n\nAn appeal to the Punjab High Court, then in session at Simla, did not find favour and the sentence was upheld. This statement is the last made by Godse before the Court.\n\nWHY I KILLED GANDHI\n\nBorn in a devotional Brahmin family, I instinctively came to revere Hindu religion, Hindu history and Hindu culture. I had, therefore, been intensely proud of Hinduism as a whole. As I grew up I developed a tendency to free thinking unfettered by any superstitious allegiance to any isms, political or religious. That is why I worked actively for the eradication of untouchability and the caste system based on birth alone. I openly joined RSS wing of anti-caste movements and maintained that all Hindus were of equal status as to rights, social and religious and should be considered high or low on merit alone and not through the accident of birth in a particular caste or profession.\n\nI used publicly to take part in organized anti-caste dinners in which thousands of Hindus, Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, Chamars and Bhangis participated. We broke the caste rules and dined in the company of each other. I have read the speeches and writings of Ravana, Chanakiya, Dadabhai Naoroji, Vivekanand, Gokhale, Tilak, along with the books of ancient and modern history of India and some prominent countries like England , France , America and Russia . Moreover I studied the tenets of Socialism and Marxism. But above all I studied very closely whatever Veer Savarkar and Gandhiji had written and spoken, as to my mind these two ideologies have contributed more to the moulding of the thought and action of the Indian people during the last thirty years or so, than any other single factor has done.\n\nAll this reading and thinking led me to believe it was my first duty to serve Hindudom and Hindus both as a patriot and as a world citizen. To secure the freedom and to safeguard the just interests of some thirty crores (300 million) of Hindus would automatically constitute the freedom and the well-being of all India , one fifth of human race. This conviction led me naturally to devote myself to the Hindu Sanghtanist ideology and programme, which alone, I came to believe, could win and preserve the national independence of Hindustan , my Motherland, and enable her to render true service to humanity as well.\n\nSince the year 1920, that is, after the demise of Lokamanya Tilak, Gandhiji\u2019s influence in the Congress first increased and then became supreme. His activities for public awakening were phenomenal in their intensity and were reinforced by the slogan of truth and non-violence which he paraded ostentatiously before the country. No sensible or enlightened person could object to those slogans. In fact there is nothing new or original in them.. They are implicit in every constitutional public movement. But it is nothing but a mere dream if you imagine that the bulk of mankind is, or can ever become, capable of scrupulous adherence to these lofty principles in its normal life from day to day.\n\nIn fact, honour, duty and love of one\u2019s own kith and kin and country might often compel us to disregard non-violence and to use force. I could never conceive that an armed resistance to an aggression is unjust. I would consider it a religious and moral duty to resist and, if possible, to overpower such an enemy by use of force. [In the Ramayana] Rama killed Ravana in a tumultuous fight and relieved Sita.. [In the Mahabharata], Krishna killed Kansa to end his wickedness; and Arjuna had to fight and slay quite a number of his friends and relations including the revered Bhishma because the latter was on the side of the aggressor. It is my firm belief that in dubbing Rama, Krishna and Arjuna as guilty of violence, the Mahatma betrayed a total ignorance of the springs of human action.\nIn more recent history, it was the heroic fight put up by Chhatrapati Shivaji that first checked and eventually destroyed the Muslim tyranny in India . It was absolutely essentially for Shivaji to overpower and kill an aggressive Afzal Khan, failing which he would have lost his own life. In condemning history\u2019s towering warriors like Shivaji, Rana Pratap and Guru Gobind Singh as misguided patriots, Gandhiji has merely exposed his self-conceit. He was, paradoxical as it may appear, a violent pacifist who brought untold calamities on the country in the name of truth and non-violence, while Rana Pratap, Shivaji and the Guru will remain enshrined in the hearts of their countrymen for ever for the freedom they brought to them.\n\nThe accumulating provocation of thirty-two years, culminating in his last pro-Muslim fast, at last goaded me to the conclusion that the existence of Gandhi should be brought to an end immediately. Gandhi had done very good in South Africa to uphold the rights and well-being of the Indian community there. But when he finally returned to India he developed a subjective mentality under which he alone was to be the final judge of what was right or wrong. If the country wanted his leadership, it had to accept his infallibility; if it did not, he would stand aloof from the Congress and carry on his own way.\n\nAgainst such an attitude there can be no halfway house. Either Congress had to surrender its will to his and had to be content with playing second fiddle to all his eccentricity, whimsicality, metaphysics and primitive vision, or it had to carry on without him. He alone was the Judge of everyone and every thing; he was the master brain guiding the civil disobedience movement; no other could know the technique of that movement. He alone knew when to begin and when to withdraw it. The movement might succeed or fail, it might bring untold disaster and political reverses but that could make no difference to the Mahatma\u2019s infallibility. \u2018A Satyagrahi can never fail\u2019 was his formula for declaring his own infallibility and nobody except himself knew what a Satyagrahi is. Thus, the Mahatma became the judge and jury in his own cause. These childish insanities and obstinacies, coupled with a most severe austerity of life, ceaseless work and lofty character made Gandhi formidable and irresistible.\n\nMany people thought that his politics were irrational but they had either to withdraw from the Congress or place their intelligence at his feet to do with as he liked. In a position of such absolute irresponsibility Gandhi was guilty of blunder after blunder, failure after failure, disaster after disaster. Gandhi\u2019s pro-Muslim policy is blatantly in his perverse attitude on the question of the national language of India . It is quite obvious that Hindi has the most prior claim to be accepted as the premier language. In the beginning of his career in India , Gandhi gave a great impetus to Hindi but as he found that the Muslims did not like it, he became a champion of what is called Hindustani.. Everybody in India knows that there is no language called Hindustani; it has no grammar; it has no vocabulary. It is a mere dialect, it is spoken, but not written. It is a bastard tongue and cross-breed between Hindi and Urdu, and not even the Mahatma\u2019s sophistry could make it popular. But in his desire to please the Muslims he insisted that Hindustani alone should be the national language of India . His blind followers, of course, supported him and the so-called hybrid language began to be used. The charm and purity of the Hindi language was to be prostituted to please the Muslims. All his experiments were at the expense of the Hindus.\n\nFrom August 1946 onwards the private armies of the Muslim League began a massacre of the Hindus. The then Viceroy, Lord Wavell, though distressed at what was happening, would not use his powers under the Government of India Act of 1935 to prevent the rape, murder and arson. The Hindu blood began to flow from Bengal to Karachi with some retaliation by the Hindus. The Interim Government formed in September was sabotaged by its Muslim League members right from its inception, but the more they became disloyal and treasonable to the government of which they were a part, the greater was Gandhi\u2019s infatuation for them. Lord Wavell had to resign as he could not bring about a settlement and he was succeeded by Lord Mountbatten. King Log was followed by King Stork. The Congress which had boasted of its nationalism and socialism secretly accepted Pakistan literally at the point of the bayonet and abjectly surrendered to Jinnah. India was vivisected and one-third of the Indian territory became foreign land to us from August 15, 1947.\n\nLord Mountbatten came to be described in Congress circles as the greatest Viceroy and Governor-General this country ever had. The official date for handing over power was fixed for June 30, 1948, but Mountbatten with his ruthless surgery gave us a gift of vivisected India ten months in advance. This is what Gandhi had achieved after thirty years of undisputed dictatorship and this is what Congress party calls \u2018freedom\u2019 and \u2018peaceful transfer of power\u2019. The Hindu-Muslim unity bubble was finally burst and a theocratic state was established with the consent of Nehru and his crowd and they have called \u2018freedom won by them with sacrifice\u2019 \u2013 whose sacrifice? When top leaders of Congress, with the consent of Gandhi, divided and tore the country \u2013 which we consider a deity of worship \u2013 my mind was filled with direful anger.\n\nOne of the conditions imposed by Gandhi for his breaking of the fast unto death related to the mosques in Delhi occupied by the Hindu refugees. But when Hindus in Pakistan were subjected to violent attacks he did not so much as utter a single word to protest and censure the Pakistan Government or the Muslims concerned. Gandhi was shrewd enough to know that while undertaking a fast unto death, had he imposed for its break some condition on the Muslims in Pakistan , there would have been found hardly any Muslims who could have shown some grief if the fast had ended in his death. It was for this reason that he purposely avoided imposing any condition on the Muslims. He was fully aware of from the experience that Jinnah was not at all perturbed or influenced by his fast and the Muslim League hardly attached any value to the inner voice of Gandhi.\n\nGandhi is being referred to as the Father of the Nation. But if that is so, he had failed his paternal duty inasmuch as he has acted very treacherously to the nation by his consenting to the partitioning of it. I stoutly maintain that Gandhi has failed in his duty. He has proved to be the Father of Pakistan. His inner-voice, his spiritual power and his doctrine of non-violence of which so much is made of, all crumbled before Jinnah\u2019s iron will and proved to be powerless. Briefly speaking, I thought to myself and foresaw I shall be totally ruined, and the only thing I could expect from the people would be nothing but hatred and that I shall have lost all my honour, even more valuable than my life, if I were to kill Gandhiji. But at the same time I felt that the Indian politics in the absence of Gandhiji would surely be proved practical, able to retaliate, and would be powerful with armed forces. No doubt, my own future would be totally ruined, but the nation would be saved from the inroads of Pakistan . People may even call me and dub me as devoid of any sense or foolish, but the nation would be free to follow the course founded on the reason which I consider to be necessary for sound nation-building.\n\nAfter having fully considered the question, I took the final decision in the matter, but I did not speak about it to anyone whatsoever. I took courage in both my hands and I did fire the shots at Gandhiji on 30th January 1948, on the prayer-grounds of Birla House. I do say that my shots were fired at the person whose policy and action had brought rack and ruin and destruction to millions of Hindus. There was no legal machinery by which such an offender could be brought to book and for this reason I fired those fatal shots. I bear no ill will towards anyone individually but I do say that I had no respect for the present government owing to their policy which was unfairly favourable towards the Muslims. But at the same time I could clearly see that the policy was entirely due to the presence of Gandhi.\n\nI have to say with great regret that Prime Minister Nehru quite forgets that his preachings and deeds are at times at variances with each other when he talks about India as a secular state in season and out of season, because it is significant to note that Nehru has played a leading role in the establishment of the theocratic state of Pakistan, and his job was made easier by Gandhi\u2019s persistent policy of appeasement towards the Muslims. I now stand before the court to accept the full share of my responsibility for what I have done and the judge would, of course, pass against me such orders of sentence as may be considered proper. But I would like to add that I do not desire any mercy to be shown to me, nor do I wish that anyone else should beg for mercy on my behalf. My confidence about the moral side of my action has not been shaken even by the criticism levelled against it on all sides. I have no doubt that honest writers of history will weigh my act and find the true value thereof some day in future.",

In the beginning of his career in India , Gandhi gave a great impetus to Hindi but as he found that the Muslims did not like it, he became a champion of what is called Hindustani.. Everybody in India knows that there is no language called Hindustani; it has no grammar; it has no vocabulary. It is a mere dialect, it is spoken, but not written. It is a bastard tongue and cross-breed between Hindi and Urdu, and not even the Mahatma\u2019s sophistry could make it popular. But in his desire to please the Muslims he insisted that Hindustani alone should be the national language of India . His blind followers, of course, supported him and the so-called hybrid language began to be used. The charm and purity of the Hindi language was to be prostituted to please the Muslims. All his experiments were at the expense of the Hindus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From August 1946 onwards the private armies of the Muslim League began a massacre of the Hindus. The then Viceroy, Lord Wavell, though distressed at what was happening, would not use his powers under the Government of India Act of 1935 to prevent the rape, murder and arson. The Hindu blood began to flow from Bengal to Karachi with some retaliation by the Hindus. The Interim Government formed in September was sabotaged by its Muslim League members right from its inception, but the more they became disloyal and treasonable to the government of which they were a part, the greater was Gandhi\u2019s infatuation for them. Lord Wavell had to resign as he could not bring about a settlement and he was succeeded by Lord Mountbatten. King Log was followed by King Stork. The Congress which had boasted of its nationalism and socialism secretly accepted Pakistan literally at the point of the bayonet and abjectly surrendered to Jinnah. India was vivisected and one-third of the Indian territory became foreign land to us from August 15, 1947.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lord Mountbatten came to be described in Congress circles as the greatest Viceroy and Governor-General this country ever had. The official date for handing over power was fixed for June 30, 1948, but Mountbatten with his ruthless surgery gave us a gift of vivisected India ten months in advance. This is what Gandhi had achieved after thirty years of undisputed dictatorship and this is what Congress party calls \u2018freedom\u2019 and \u2018peaceful transfer of power\u2019. The Hindu-Muslim unity bubble was finally burst and a theocratic state was established with the consent of Nehru and his crowd and they have called \u2018freedom won by them with sacrifice\u2019 \u2013 whose sacrifice? When top leaders of Congress, with the consent of Gandhi, divided and tore the country \u2013 which we consider a deity of worship \u2013 my mind was filled with direful anger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the conditions imposed by Gandhi for his breaking of the fast unto death related to the mosques in Delhi occupied by the Hindu refugees. But when Hindus in Pakistan were subjected to violent attacks he did not so much as utter a single word to protest and censure the Pakistan Government or the Muslims concerned. Gandhi was shrewd enough to know that while undertaking a fast unto death, had he imposed for its break some condition on the Muslims in Pakistan , there would have been found hardly any Muslims who could have shown some grief if the fast had ended in his death. It was for this reason that he purposely avoided imposing any condition on the Muslims. He was fully aware of from the experience that Jinnah was not at all perturbed or influenced by his fast and the Muslim League hardly attached any value to the inner voice of Gandhi.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gandhi is being referred to as the Father of the Nation. But if that is so, he had failed his paternal duty inasmuch as he has acted very treacherously to the nation by his consenting to the partitioning of it. I stoutly maintain that Gandhi has failed in his duty. He has proved to be the Father of Pakistan. His inner-voice, his spiritual power and his doctrine of non-violence of which so much is made of, all crumbled before Jinnah\u2019s iron will and proved to be powerless. Briefly speaking, I thought to myself and foresaw I shall be totally ruined, and the only thing I could expect from the people would be nothing but hatred and that I shall have lost all my honour, even more valuable than my life, if I were to kill Gandhiji. But at the same time I felt that the Indian politics in the absence of Gandhiji would surely be proved practical, able to retaliate, and would be powerful with armed forces. No doubt, my own future would be totally ruined, but the nation would be saved from the inroads of Pakistan . People may even call me and dub me as devoid of any sense or foolish, but the nation would be free to follow the course founded on the reason which I consider to be necessary for sound nation-building.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After having fully considered the question, I took the final decision in the matter, but I did not speak about it to anyone whatsoever. I took courage in both my hands and I did fire the shots at Gandhiji on 30th January 1948, on the prayer-grounds of Birla House. I do say that my shots were fired at the person whose policy and action had brought rack and ruin and destruction to millions of Hindus. There was no legal machinery by which such an offender could be brought to book and for this reason I fired those fatal shots. I bear no ill will towards anyone individually but I do say that I had no respect for the present government owing to their policy which was unfairly favourable towards the Muslims. But at the same time I could clearly see that the policy was entirely due to the presence of Gandhi.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have to say with great regret that Prime Minister Nehru quite forgets that his preachings and deeds are at times at variances with each other when he talks about India as a secular state in season and out of season, because it is significant to note that Nehru has played a leading role in the establishment of the theocratic state of Pakistan, and his job was made easier by Gandhi\u2019s persistent policy of appeasement towards the Muslims. I now stand before the court to accept the full share of my responsibility for what I have done and the judge would, of course, pass against me such orders of sentence as may be considered proper. But I would like to add that I do not desire any mercy to be shown to me, nor do I wish that anyone else should beg for mercy on my behalf. My confidence about the moral side of my action has not been shaken even by the criticism levelled against it on all sides. I have no doubt that honest writers of history will weigh my act and find the true value thereof some day in future.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Because of censorship on the internet, any such article gets taken down immediately and don\u2019t be surprised if this particular post gets this subreddit itself banned. I recommend sharing this as much as possible until it is removed.\n\n\u201cGhazwa-e-Hind\u201d is an Islamic concept that is given in the Hadith. Ghazwa means barbaric war. Ghazwa-e-Hind means a barbaric war of conquering India. According to Muslim beliefs, this war will occur before Kayamat and after this war, every Hindu will be converted into Islam by force. \n\n&gt;It was narrated that Thawban, the freed slave of the Messenger of Allah, said: \"The Messenger of Allah said: 'There are two groups of my Ummah whom Allah will free from the Fire: The group that invades India and the group that will be with 'Isa bin Maryam, peace be upon him.'\" - Sunan an-Nasa'i 1:25:3177 (hasan) from The Book of Jihad.\n\n[Source to the Hadith](https://sunnah.com/nasai/25)\n\nNow, most Muslims dismiss this by saying that this Hadith is weak and fabricated. But then this happened - \n\n&gt;\"Pakistanis should consider themselves fortunate that Allah has bestowed the honour to wage war against India to them,\" a prominent Islamic cleric and former banker Irfan-ul-Haq, was caught on video speaking\u00a0to a Pakistani audience during a lecture in 2011.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Uploaded by author Tarek Fatah recently, the cleric, in the video, said: \"the Prophet had said that there will be a war in India that will be *Ghazwa-e-Hind*\".  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The cleric further added that\u00a0if there was a place on earth where people worshipped stone idols, it was the Indian subcontinent.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cThe genesis of Pakistan was prophesied to defeat India and Hinduism at the hands of Pakistan,\u201d Haq said in the video. The cleric went\u00a0on to say that Pakistan's creation was done solely to destroy Hinduism and that Pakistan\u2019s military and people will swarm India and wipe out, once and for all, the practice of Hinduism from the face of the earth.\n\n[Source](https://www.firstpost.com/world/pakistan-was-created-to-destroy-india-and-hinduism-2011-video-of-islamic-cleric-resurfaces-2569916.html)\n\nIf you noticed, the original Youtube account associated with this video, as well as Tarak Fatah's blog has been taken down. Internet censorship at it's best. However, there is another [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12krbbKA6X0) from the same lecture.\n\nLet us look back at history, the Indian subcontinent was \"strategically\" divided into modern-day India and Pakistan in 1947.  The simple reason was that it was the Muslims who were applying pressure for a separate Islamic homeland and not the Hindus. As Hindus weren't really concerned with an explicitly Hindu homeland, they did not force the issue. It is a commonly known fact that 90% of Muslims voted for Pakistan, whereas the rest stayed here. If Muslims could stay in India, it was more because of the liberal attitude of Hindu neighbors towards their Muslim fellows but the same thing was not reciprocated by Muslims towards their Hindu fellows. As a result, wherever Hindus were less in number, either they were forced to leave Pakistan or they were mostly murdered. While Jinnah called for the creation of an Islamic nation, leaders like Gandhi and Nehru pitched for a \"secular\" India. \n\nWhat is secularism? A quick Google search will provide you with the following definition:\n\n&gt; the principle of separation of the state from religious institutions. \n\nBut in diverse geography like the then Indian subcontinent, which was divided into various religious and cultural sects, where the state itself functioned on the basis of religious institutions, which is contradictory to the very definition of secularism, how do you expect secularism to work in modern-day India? Hindus and Muslims (referring to the ideologies and not individuals) are like oil and water and one should not mix them together. Where one worships idols and believes in the peaceful coexistence of everyone, the other considers idol worship as an unforgivable sin and demands that everyone worship none other than Allah. \n\n&gt;Abu Hurairah told him that the Messenger of Allah said: \"I have been commanded to fight the people until they say La ilaha illallah (there is none worthy of worship except Allah). Whoever says La ilaha illallah, his life and his property are safe from me, except by its right (in cases where Islamic laws apply), and his reckoning will be with Allah.'\u201d - Sunan an-Nasa'i 1:25:3092 (sahih) from The Book of Jihad.\n\n[Source to the Hadith](https://sunnah.com/nasai/25)\n\nThe gravity of this situation was understood by certain prominent leaders like Savarkar and Sardar Patel who later gave up the idea of complete transfer of the Muslim population from India to Pakistan after Gandhi went on a notorious hunger strike. As a result, India was left with a representable Muslim population.\n\nLet us look at how the first \"democratically\" elected prime minister of the country, Jawaharlal Nehru, came to power. I'm citing an answer from Quora, the authenticity of the facts of which can be verified by various resources available online.\n\n&gt;By 1946, when the second world war was coming to an end, Britishers were thinking of transferring power to Indians and independence was just a matter of time.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A government was to be formed headed by the Congress president as Congress had won a maximum number of seats in 1946 elections. 3 people were in race namely Nehru, Maulana Azad (who was president of the congress from the last 6 years during world war 2) and none other than the Iron Man of India, Sardar Patel. But soon, Maulana Azad was out of the race as Gandhi made it clear that he will not give a second term to the sitting Congress president.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The last date of nominations for the post of Congress president and the Prime Minister of India was April 29, 1946.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Total 15 state/regional committees nominated for the post. Despite Gandhi\u2019s well-known preference for Nehru, not a single committee nominated for him. 12/15 nominated for Sardar Patel and the rest 3 didn't nominate anybody\u2019s name.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The majority was with Sardar Patel. Gandhi then conveyed this message to Nehru that no members of the committees nominated his name.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Nehru was resistant to the post and made it clear that he will not play any second role to anybody.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Gandhi then asked Sardar Patel to withdraw his name for the post of Congress president. Sardar Patel had immense respect for Gandhi and he immediately withdrew his name without wasting any time and thus Nehru became the first Prime Minister of India.   \n\n[Source](https://www.quora.com/How-was-Independent-Indias-first-PM-elected?no_redirect=1) (minor edits have been made to fix grammatical errors).\n\nSo you see, the partition of India and the creation of Pakistan was not a sudden occurrence but rather a well thought and sinister political move, the facts of which have been overshadowed over the years of constant censorship of information, spreading of misinformation and propaganda. In the following years, history was \"selectively\" written by the ruling party which best fits their motive. \n\nAfter 1971, East Pakistan was liberated as Bangladesh. The original constitution of Bangladesh, written in 1972, enshrined secularism as one of the four pillars of the newly-formed People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh and defined the word \u201cBengali\u201d as a demonym for its citizens.  In 1977, the principle of secularism was removed from the constitution through the 5th Amendment, as were references to freedom of religion for minorities, and was replaced with the statement: \"absolute trust and faith in almighty Allah\". In 1988, the government of Muhammad Ershad passed the National Religion Bill in the Jatiyo Sangsad Bhaban (Parliament of Bangladesh), declaring Islam as the state religion. \n\nAs is the case with any Islamic country, the persecution and ultimately decimation of the non-Muslim population is inevitable. A detailed [study of demographics](https://www.newslaundry.com/2015/01/09/the-vanishing-hindus-of-pakistan-a-demographic-study-2) of the populations of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh is a much needed reality check.\n\nIn short, Pakistan and Bangladesh were conceived out of deceit and treachery and the two waves of Ghazwa-e-Hind were successful. The final battle, the third and final wave to conquer the entire Indian subcontinent is approaching sooner than you think. It won't be a direct military conflict but a social, political and psychological one, the obvious signs of which have started to surface and take violent forms after the 2014 general elections since the rise of Narendra Modi is an imminent threat to the agenda of the Islamists. The left-wing media and government itself are funded by organizations who are actively working for the success of Ghazwa-e-Hind. I cannot link a source here as such a bold claim or study has no chance of floating around for long. However, it doesn't take much to figure out what's working in the shadows. The 10% of Muslims who stayed here were given preferential treatment all these years, not just to use them as a vote bank but because they were the \"seeds\" of a greater conspiracy that was going to unfold in the coming time. Maybe, the common Muslims or the so called liberals don't even have any awareness of this that they are in fact, being used as mere pawns in a bigger, sinister game. \n\nMust read articles:\n\n* [Prophecy &amp; the Jihad in the Indian Subcontinent](https://www.hudson.org/research/11167-prophecy-the-jihad-in-the-indian-subcontinent)\n* [Cleansing Pakistan of Minorities](https://www.hudson.org/research/9781-cleansing-pakistan-of-minorities)\n* [Is India prepared for the fatal threat that is being long ignored?](https://karnasena.com/is-india-prepared-for-threat-saudi-arabia-wahabbism/)\n* [Ghazwa-e-Hind: Revival and Re-Assertion Dangerous To Indian Security](http://www.newageislam.com/islam-and-politics/r-upadhyay/ghazwa-e-hind--revival-and-re-assertion-dangerous-to-indian-security/d/111697)\n\nJai Hind.

According to Muslim beliefs, this war will occur before Kayamat and after this war, every Hindu will be converted into Islam by force. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It was narrated that Thawban, the freed slave of the Messenger of Allah, said: &amp;quot;The Messenger of Allah said: &amp;#39;There are two groups of my Ummah whom Allah will free from the Fire: The group that invades India and the group that will be with &amp;#39;Isa bin Maryam, peace be upon him.&amp;#39;&amp;quot; - Sunan an-Nasa&amp;#39;i 1:25:3177 (hasan) from The Book of Jihad.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://sunnah.com/nasai/25\"&gt;Source to the Hadith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, most Muslims dismiss this by saying that this Hadith is weak and fabricated. But then this happened - &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Pakistanis should consider themselves fortunate that Allah has bestowed the honour to wage war against India to them,&amp;quot; a prominent Islamic cleric and former banker Irfan-ul-Haq, was caught on video speaking\u00a0to a Pakistani audience during a lecture in 2011.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Uploaded by author Tarek Fatah recently, the cleric, in the video, said: &amp;quot;the Prophet had said that there will be a war in India that will be &lt;em&gt;Ghazwa-e-Hind&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cleric further added that\u00a0if there was a place on earth where people worshipped stone idols, it was the Indian subcontinent.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe genesis of Pakistan was prophesied to defeat India and Hinduism at the hands of Pakistan,\u201d Haq said in the video. The cleric went\u00a0on to say that Pakistan&amp;#39;s creation was done solely to destroy Hinduism and that Pakistan\u2019s military and people will swarm India and wipe out, once and for all, the practice of Hinduism from the face of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.firstpost.com/world/pakistan-was-created-to-destroy-india-and-hinduism-2011-video-of-islamic-cleric-resurfaces-2569916.html\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you noticed, the original Youtube account associated with this video, as well as Tarak Fatah&amp;#39;s blog has been taken down. Internet censorship at it&amp;#39;s best. However, there is another &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12krbbKA6X0\"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; from the same lecture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let us look back at history, the Indian subcontinent was &amp;quot;strategically&amp;quot; divided into modern-day India and Pakistan in 1947.  The simple reason was that it was the Muslims who were applying pressure for a separate Islamic homeland and not the Hindus. As Hindus weren&amp;#39;t really concerned with an explicitly Hindu homeland, they did not force the issue. It is a commonly known fact that 90% of Muslims voted for Pakistan, whereas the rest stayed here. If Muslims could stay in India, it was more because of the liberal attitude of Hindu neighbors towards their Muslim fellows but the same thing was not reciprocated by Muslims towards their Hindu fellows. As a result, wherever Hindus were less in number, either they were forced to leave Pakistan or they were mostly murdered. While Jinnah called for the creation of an Islamic nation, leaders like Gandhi and Nehru pitched for a &amp;quot;secular&amp;quot; India. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What is secularism? A quick Google search will provide you with the following definition:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;the principle of separation of the state from religious institutions. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in diverse geography like the then Indian subcontinent, which was divided into various religious and cultural sects, where the state itself functioned on the basis of religious institutions, which is contradictory to the very definition of secularism, how do you expect secularism to work in modern-day India? Hindus and Muslims (referring to the ideologies and not individuals) are like oil and water and one should not mix them together. Where one worships idols and believes in the peaceful coexistence of everyone, the other considers idol worship as an unforgivable sin and demands that everyone worship none other than Allah. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Abu Hurairah told him that the Messenger of Allah said: &amp;quot;I have been commanded to fight the people until they say La ilaha illallah (there is none worthy of worship except Allah). Whoever says La ilaha illallah, his life and his property are safe from me, except by its right (in cases where Islamic laws apply), and his reckoning will be with Allah.&amp;#39;\u201d - Sunan an-Nasa&amp;#39;i 1:25:3092 (sahih) from The Book of Jihad.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://sunnah.com/nasai/25\"&gt;Source to the Hadith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The gravity of this situation was understood by certain prominent leaders like Savarkar and Sardar Patel who later gave up the idea of complete transfer of the Muslim population from India to Pakistan after Gandhi went on a notorious hunger strike. As a result, India was left with a representable Muslim population.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let us look at how the first &amp;quot;democratically&amp;quot; elected prime minister of the country, Jawaharlal Nehru, came to power. I&amp;#39;m citing an answer from Quora, the authenticity of the facts of which can be verified by various resources available online.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;By 1946, when the second world war was coming to an end, Britishers were thinking of transferring power to Indians and independence was just a matter of time.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A government was to be formed headed by the Congress president as Congress had won a maximum number of seats in 1946 elections. 3 people were in race namely Nehru, Maulana Azad (who was president of the congress from the last 6 years during world war 2) and none other than the Iron Man of India, Sardar Patel. But soon, Maulana Azad was out of the race as Gandhi made it clear that he will not give a second term to the sitting Congress president.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last date of nominations for the post of Congress president and the Prime Minister of India was April 29, 1946.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Total 15 state/regional committees nominated for the post. Despite Gandhi\u2019s well-known preference for Nehru, not a single committee nominated for him. 12/15 nominated for Sardar Patel and the rest 3 didn&amp;#39;t nominate anybody\u2019s name.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The majority was with Sardar Patel. Gandhi then conveyed this message to Nehru that no members of the committees nominated his name.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nehru was resistant to the post and made it clear that he will not play any second role to anybody.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gandhi then asked Sardar Patel to withdraw his name for the post of Congress president. Sardar Patel had immense respect for Gandhi and he immediately withdrew his name without wasting any time and thus Nehru became the first Prime Minister of India.   &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.quora.com/How-was-Independent-Indias-first-PM-elected?no_redirect=1\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; (minor edits have been made to fix grammatical errors).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you see, the partition of India and the creation of Pakistan was not a sudden occurrence but rather a well thought and sinister political move, the facts of which have been overshadowed over the years of constant censorship of information, spreading of misinformation and propaganda. In the following years, history was &amp;quot;selectively&amp;quot; written by the ruling party which best fits their motive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After 1971, East Pakistan was liberated as Bangladesh. The original constitution of Bangladesh, written in 1972, enshrined secularism as one of the four pillars of the newly-formed People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh and defined the word \u201cBengali\u201d as a demonym for its citizens.  In 1977, the principle of secularism was removed from the constitution through the 5th Amendment, as were references to freedom of religion for minorities, and was replaced with the statement: &amp;quot;absolute trust and faith in almighty Allah&amp;quot;. In 1988, the government of Muhammad Ershad passed the National Religion Bill in the Jatiyo Sangsad Bhaban (Parliament of Bangladesh), declaring Islam as the state religion. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As is the case with any Islamic country, the persecution and ultimately decimation of the non-Muslim population is inevitable. A detailed &lt;a href=\"https://www.newslaundry.com/2015/01/09/the-vanishing-hindus-of-pakistan-a-demographic-study-2\"&gt;study of demographics&lt;/a&gt; of the populations of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh is a much needed reality check.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In short, Pakistan and Bangladesh were conceived out of deceit and treachery and the two waves of Ghazwa-e-Hind were successful. The final battle, the third and final wave to conquer the entire Indian subcontinent is approaching sooner than you think. It won&amp;#39;t be a direct military conflict but a social, political and psychological one, the obvious signs of which have started to surface and take violent forms after the 2014 general elections since the rise of Narendra Modi is an imminent threat to the agenda of the Islamists. The left-wing media and government itself are funded by organizations who are actively working for the success of Ghazwa-e-Hind. I cannot link a source here as such a bold claim or study has no chance of floating around for long. However, it doesn&amp;#39;t take much to figure out what&amp;#39;s working in the shadows. The 10% of Muslims who stayed here were given preferential treatment all these years, not just to use them as a vote bank but because they were the &amp;quot;seeds&amp;quot; of a greater conspiracy that was going to unfold in the coming time. Maybe, the common Muslims or the so called liberals don&amp;#39;t even have any awareness of this that they are in fact, being used as mere pawns in a bigger, sinister game. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Must read articles:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.hudson.org/research/11167-prophecy-the-jihad-in-the-indian-subcontinent\"&gt;Prophecy &amp;amp; the Jihad in the Indian Subcontinent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.hudson.org/research/9781-cleansing-pakistan-of-minorities\"&gt;Cleansing Pakistan of Minorities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://karnasena.com/is-india-prepared-for-threat-saudi-arabia-wahabbism/\"&gt;Is India prepared for the fatal threat that is being long ignored?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.newageislam.com/islam-and-politics/r-upadhyay/ghazwa-e-hind--revival-and-re-assertion-dangerous-to-indian-security/d/111697\"&gt;Ghazwa-e-Hind: Revival and Re-Assertion Dangerous To Indian Security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jai Hind.

     "selftext": "If you ask anybody, most will tell you that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), is an Indian right-wing, Hindu nationalist, paramilitary volunteer organization that is widely regarded as the parent organization of the ruling party of India, the Bharatiya Janata Party. Then there are those that label RSS as a terrorist organization. Following is a list of good things done by RSS which the biased (or shall I say anti-Hindu?) media won\u2019t tell you.\n\n**1. The very foundation of this organization is based on nationalist ideals.**\n\nIt was K.B Hedgewar, a Nagpur based doctor who founded the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). He drew upon influences from great Indians such as Swami Vivekananda, Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, and Aurobindo to develop the core philosophy of the RSS. The intention of promoting the concept of a United India, deeply rooted in indigenous ideology was the main objective.\n\nCan an organization based on the ideals of such great men work against the interests of the nation?\n\n**2. With a presence in over 50,000 villages and towns in the country, it is the biggest NGO in the world.**\n\nThe organization portrays itself as a \u2018social movement.\u2019 The top leaders always refuse to consider the organization as a political entity.\n\nOften portrayed in a bad light by several journalists and media houses, RSS happens to be the world\u2019s largest voluntary non-governmental organization. It is based on the principle of selfless service to the nation.\n\nThere is no formal membership procedure for RSS. Anyone can join the nearest \u2018*Shakha*\u2019, which is the basic unit and activity of RSS. There are no fees and no typical registration process. Once you start attending Shakha, you are considered a member.\n\n**3. Not just Hindus, there\u2019re Muslim and Sikh members too!**\n\nSome people wrongly assume that RSS is against every other religion, but the reality is that the organization treats Muslims, Christians and everyone else in India as cultural Hindus. Anyone can become a member of RSS; till the time they believe in India\u2019s sovereignty. What is wrong with that?\n\nConsider this:\n\nThe Muslim Rashtriya Manch (MRM) is a Muslim organization in India and it is affiliated to the Hindu nationalist RSS. MRM was formed in 2002 by nationalist Muslims and Hindus.\n\nRashtriya Sikh Sangat was formed on 24 Nov 1986, on the Guruprakash Purab of Guru Nanak Ji and is an independent socio-cultural organization. The organization aims to promote Sikh-Hindu relations and to spread the knowledge of Gurbani to not only the Sikh masses of India but also to the rest of Indian society.\n\nIs that not secular enough?\n\n**4. Did RSS instigate accession of J&amp;K into India?**\n\nOn 18th Oct 1947, then Home Minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel requested the 2nd *Sarsanghachalak* M.S. Golwalkar to meet Maharaja Hari Singh to persuade the Maharaja to accede to India. \n\nHe was accompanied by other RSS *pracharaks.* It is believed that the Maharaja agreed to the proposal, but the formal accession was signed only on the 26 October, after the invasion by raiders from Pakistan. Jinnah had plans in place to kill the King by 24th and capture Sri Nagar by 25th Oct.\n\nRSS volunteers not only provided early leads to the Indian Army about Pakistan\u2019s upcoming attack at that time but also protected Hari Singh by mobilizing 200 volunteers.\n\nToday, the Muslim Rashtriya Manch has more than 4,500 workers in Kashmir valley, with around 800 NGOs working with them.\n\n**5. The charitable pursuits of RSS and Sangh in J&amp;K, especially for building a better future for children have always remained buried.**\n\nSeva Bharati, an RSS inspired community service organization, has adopted a hundred children from the insurgency and militancy affected regions of Jammu and Kashmir. There are Hindus and Muslims both. Their stay and educational needs are funded by the Seva Bharati and today, many of them are studying in boarding schools in Delhi.\n\nIn addition, Seva Bharati run by RSS *swayamsevaks*, has extended a helping hand in flood-hit areas of Jammu &amp; Kashmir and also regularly organizes blood camps. It also looks out for the interests of the poor, downtrodden and weaker sections of the society.\n\nWith such dedication shown by the Sangh towards the people of J&amp;K, it\u2019s no surprise that most of the allegations against RSS stemming out of the political parties cannot be taken to be true.\n\n**6. Sangh played a significant role in getting Dadra &amp; Nagar Haveli and Goa from colonialists.**\n\nEven after the independence, Dadra &amp; Nagar Haveli was internationally recognized to be in Portuguese possession.\n\nThe unwillingness of the colonist to leave the Indian Territory was opposed by the RSS and it participated in movements to decolonize Dadra and Nagar Haveli.\n\nIn April 1954, the RSS formed a coalition with the National Movement Liberation Organization (NMLO), and the Azad Gomantak Dal (AGD) for the liberation of Dadra and Nagar Haveli. On 28 July, volunteer teams of the RSS and AGD captured the territories of Naroli and Phiparia and ultimately the capital of Silvassa.\n\nIn 1955, RSS leaders demanded the end of Portuguese rule in Goa and its integration into India. When Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru refused to provide an armed intervention, RSS leader Jagannath Rao Joshi led the Satyagraha agitation straight into Goa itself. He was imprisoned with his followers by the Portuguese police. The peaceful protests continued but met with severe repressions.\n\nAn organization sacrificing its blood, sweat, and tears for the unification of the nation deserves gratitude and respect, not accusations of being an anti-national front.\n\n**7. Even Jawaharlal Nehru acknowledged the service rendered to the Nation by RSS during the 1962 war.**\n\nThe RSS was at the forefront of voluntary work during the India- China war of 1962; then Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru even invited the RSS to take part in the Republic Day parade of 1963.\n\nAnd the likes of Digvijaya Singh can\u2019t stop blaming this organization for every other thing they are not comfortable with!\n\n**8. In 1965, during the Indo-Pak war, RSS was appointed for controlling traffic in lieu of freeing policemen for defense.**\n\nDuring the 1965 war between India and Pakistan RSS was again involved in voluntary work and then Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri requested RSS cadres to help control traffic in Delhi, so policemen could be freed for defense duties. \n\n**9. RSS was instrumental in maintaining Law and order during the 1971 war.**\n\nDuring the Bangladesh War of Independence, RSS volunteers maintained law and order in the country when most of the government machinery was deployed in the war effort.\n\nThe swayamsevaks were also the first to donate blood in 1971.\n\n**10. Sangh was deeply involved in ensuring voluntary participation in land reforms.**\n\nRSS volunteers participated in the Bhoodan movement organized by Gandhian leader Vinobha Bhave. Vinobha Bhave had met the RSS leader M. S. Golwalkar in 1951 who had pledged support to the movement.\n\nMany RSS volunteers led by Nanaji Deshmukh participated in the movement.\n\n**11. IT\u2019S TRUE, there is no place for caste prejudices or untouchability in the world of RSS teachings.**\n\nDuring M. K. Gandhi\u2019s visit to RSS Camp in 1934, he was surprised by the discipline and the absence of untouchability in the camps. Even *Dalit* leader Dr. B R Ambedkar while visiting the RSS camp at Pune in 1939 observed that Swayamsevaks were moving in absolute equality and brotherhood.\n\nWhen he asked Dr. Hedgewar whether there were any untouchables in the camp, he replied that there are neither \u201ctouchables\u201d nor \u201cuntouchables\u201d \u2013 only Hindus.\n\nThe RSS has endeavored hard to ensure caste divisions in India are removed and have advocated the training of *Dalits* and other backward classes as temple high priests. RSS aims to remove such division to ensure the society is untied to work for the overall development of India.\n\nThis was evident in the Sangh\u2019s backing of Narendra Modi, who himself is a member of OBC.\n\n**12. No one ever mentioned it \u2013 but RSS volunteers were the first to extend help for Uttarakhand Flood Victims.**\n\nThe recent Uttarakhand flash floods saw the RSS volunteers come out in huge numbers to assist in relief work. In 2006, RSS participated in relief efforts to provide basic necessities such as food, milk and potable water to the people of Surat, Gujarat who were affected by massive floods in the region. The RSS volunteers carried out massive relief and rehabilitation work after the floods ravaged North Karnataka and some districts of the state of Andhra Pradesh.\n\n**13. Sangh has been proactive in protecting religious minorities and the organization promotes the concept of gender equality.**\n\nRSS helped in protecting Sikhs during the 1984 Anti-Sikh Riots. Sikh intellectual and author of \u2018A History of the Sikhs\u2019, Khushwant Singh, credits members of the RSS with helping and protecting Sikhs who were being targeted during the 1984 Anti-Sikh Riots.\n\nSangh has also worked on empowering women via the formation of a women\u2019s wing of RSS.  There are two kinds of RSS setups, one for males called the Rastriya Swayamsevak Sangh and Rastra Sevika Samiti for females. Both have been thriving in India for decades and acknowledge the importance of women as building blocks of a progressive nation.",
     "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you ask anybody, most will tell you that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), is an Indian right-wing, Hindu nationalist, paramilitary volunteer organization that is widely regarded as the parent organization of the ruling party of India, the Bharatiya Janata Party. Then there are those that label RSS as a terrorist organization. Following is a list of good things done by RSS which the biased (or shall I say anti-Hindu?) media won\u2019t tell you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. The very foundation of this organization is based on nationalist ideals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was K.B Hedgewar, a Nagpur based doctor who founded the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). He drew upon influences from great Indians such as Swami Vivekananda, Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, and Aurobindo to develop the core philosophy of the RSS. The intention of promoting the concept of a United India, deeply rooted in indigenous ideology was the main objective.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can an organization based on the ideals of such great men work against the interests of the nation?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. With a presence in over 50,000 villages and towns in the country, it is the biggest NGO in the world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The organization portrays itself as a \u2018social movement.\u2019 The top leaders always refuse to consider the organization as a political entity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Often portrayed in a bad light by several journalists and media houses, RSS happens to be the world\u2019s largest voluntary non-governmental organization.

     "selftext": "26th February is the death anniversary of Veer Savarkar, one of the bravest revolutionary freedom fighters of India. Vinayak Damodar Savarkar was born on 28 May 1883 in Maharashtra. Savarkar, since his childhood was attracted towards freedom movement and while he was studying in school, he developed the habit of participating in freedom fights. Fearlessness, bravery was the hallmark of this young boy who had a determination to get India out from the hands of the British.\n\nIt was the time when British used the tactics of divide and rule. They propped up Hindus against Muslims and spread communal hatred in places where the freedom movement gained momentum. When Savarkar was only 12 years old, he witnessed communal clash for first time in his village. A gang of Muslims attacked his village, burning down houses and forcing people to convert to Islam. Veer Savarkar at a young age had resisted this Muslim domination in his town and although his boys were outnumbered, he inspired his friends to join him and chase away the Muslim mob which had attacked his village. The boys fought until last man in the mob was sent out of the village.\n\nThis incident disturbed Veer Savarkar very much. He understood that different community members were pitched against each other by the British in order break India and they had succeeded in their ploy to divide India on religion and caste. He realised that Indians were losing national identity and there was a need for a nationalist movement to galvanize the people of India. At just 15 years, he started a youth organisation called Mitra Mela (Band of Friends) to advocate nationalist ideas. Same time he lost his parents and his elder brother, Ganesh, took the responsibility of the family.\n\nIn 1902, he joined the Fergusson college in Pune for BA, where he started giving speeches on nationalism, patriotism and revolutionary movements. He was inspired by Lokamanya Balgangadarnath Tilak\u2019s call to boycott all foreign clothes and organized a bonfire during Dusshera festival to burn all foreign clothes. At a small age of 18 years, he started writing poems, books on nationalism and Hinduism. He was fondly called VEER by his friends for his unbending attitude.\n\nAfter he completed his degree, nationalist activist Shyamji Krishna Varma helped Vinayak to go to England to study law, on a scholarship. It was then, Tilak started an organisation called Garam Dal, literally \u201cArmy of the angry\u201d as a result of a split between the Indian National Congress and Tilak. Tilak was upset with Congress's ideology to hold talks with British and convince them to leave India. He felt that many leaders in the Congress were happy under the British rule and were developing the radical mindset which was against the core ethics of the nation. Tilak was immediately jailed for opposing the INC and British.\n\nSavarkar in England started Free India Society to motivate students in freedom struggle and declared to fight for independence through revolutionary ideas. He said  \u201cWe must stop complaining about this British officer or that officer, this law or that law. There would be no end to that. Our movement must not be limited to being against any particular law, but it must be for acquiring the authority to make laws itself. In other words, we want absolute independence.\u201d\n\nSavarkar who was an avid reader, read many books on war techniques and applied them in freedom movement. He believed that the right strategy was the keen to tackle British and wrote a book emphasizing guerrilla warfare called 'The History of the War of Indian Independence'. It was via this book that Savarkar became one of the first writers to allude the uprising as India\u2019s \u201cFirst War for Independence\u201d. The book gained so much popularity in a short span, that the British banned the book throughout India.\n\nIn India, Ganesh Savarkar organised an armed revolt against the Morley-Minto reforms of 1909 after which he was arrested and sent to cellular jail in Andaman islands. The British also named Savarkar in the case for plotting the crime and was issued a look out notice for Savarkar. Finally, in 1910 he was arrested in Paris and shipped to India. Savarkar escaped from the ship and swam for over 2 Km in sea to reach the shore hoping that his friend would be there to help him. But the late arrival of his friend helped the British recapture him and he was taken to jail.\n\nArriving in Bombay, Savarkar was taken to the Yervada Central Jail in Pune. Following a trial, Savarkar, aged 28, was convicted and sentenced to 50-years imprisonment and transported on 4 July 1911 to the infamous Cellular Jail in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.\n\nFrom here started Savarkar\u2019s life of Hell!\n\nSavarkar in cellular Jail was treated with utmost disrespect, humiliated and insulted by British jailer. Savarkar was given a corner cell where he had no access to any outer world. He was made to work for 18 hours a day, given minimum food and minimum clothes. He was made to work for hours without break in oil mill under regimental strictness, he wasn\u2019t allowed to talk to anyone including his brother who was in the same jail. He was tortured on a daily basis by the British officers beating him, abusing him and poking him with hot iron sticks. But Savarkar never broke down even once. He was made to see the hanging of his fellow inmates and freedom fighters to make him mentally weak. He was made to witness the torture of his friends where their head was smacked with iron rods and sticks.\n\nIt was then Savarakar decided to write his views and ideas of nationalism and Hinduism. He was denied access to pen and paper after which he plucked his own nails, collected thorns and pebbles to write on the walls of the cell. He spent 13 years in cellular jail writing endless scripts on nationalism. His famous description of who is Hindu, who is a nationalist was written on the walls of the cells.\n\nHe described a Hindu as \u2014 a patriotic inhabitant of Bharatavarsha, venturing beyond a religious identity. He described Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism and Buddhism as one and the same. He outlined his vision of a \u201cHindu Rashtra\u201d (Hindu Nation) as \u201cAkhand Bharat\u201d (United India), purportedly stretching across the entire Indian subcontinent. He defined Hindus as being neither Aryan nor Dravidian but as \u201cPeople who live as children of a common motherland, adoring a common holyland.\u201d\n\nFinally in 1923, due to extreme pressure from Tilak and other prominent leaders, Savarkar was released under strict conditions of not participating in politics for 5 years and barring to leave Ratnagiri district. Savarkar who was barred from participating in politics, focused on abolishing untouchability in the district. He fought for caste unity and achieved 100% success in a span of just 2 years. Dr B.R. Ambedkar who was the editor of the \u2018Janta\u2019, a monthly, was impressed by Savarkar\u2019s work so much that he compared his work to Lord Buddha.\n\nHe continued his work on nationalism and opposed the Gandhian principles of Ahimsa saying that Indians were not cowards and we cannot beg foreigners for Independence. He strongly pitched for a uniform civil code and strongly opposed the division of India based on religion.\n\nBased on Dr B.R. Ambedkar\u2019s writing \u2014 Mr. Savarkar insists that, although there are two nations in India, India shall not be divided into two parts, one for Muslims and the other for the Hindus; that the two nations shall dwell in one country and shall live under the mantle of one single constitution. In the struggle for political power between the two nations, the rule of the game which Mr. Savarkar prescribes is to be one man one vote, be the man Hindu or Muslim. In his scheme, a Muslim is to have no advantage which a Hindu does not have. Minority is to be no justification for privilege and majority is to be no ground for penalty. The state will guarantee the Muslims any defined measure of political power in the form of Muslim religion and Muslim culture. But the State will not guarantee secured seats in the Legislature or in the Administration and, if such guarantee is insisted upon by the Muslims, such guaranteed quota is not to exceed their proportion to the general population.\n\nHe wrote more than 8 books in his lifetime and over 10,000 pages in Marathi language. His literary works in Marathi include \u201cKamala\u201c, \u201cMazi Janmathep\u201d (My Life Sentence), and most famously 1857 \u2013 The First War of Independence, in which Savarkar popularised the term \u201cFirst War of Independence.\u201d Kale Pani (Black Water which means \u201clife sentence\u201d on the island prison on the Andaman islands), which reflected the treatment of Indian Independence activists by the British. He wrote an inspirational historical work, Saha Soneri Pane (Six Golden Pages), recounting some of the \u201cGolden periods\u201d of Indian history.  He wrote the atrocities of British and Muslims on Hindu residents in Kerala in the book, Mopalyanche Band (Muslims\u2019 Strike) and also Gandhi Gondhal (Gandhi\u2019s Confusion), a political critique of Gandhi\u2019s politics.\n\nHis poems include, Sagara pran talmalala (O Great Sea, My Heart Aches for the Motherland), and Jayostute (written in praise of freedom).\n\nHe spent his life fighting for the country but was accused by Congress of inciting violence and hatred. But B.R. Ambedkar believed that Savarkar's way of life and his fight to unite all castes and religions was something which was recognized by very few. Savarak became the victim of political games of Congress which found him as an easy target. But even today, his ideas about nationalism, love for country and the struggle he faced can never be denied and he became a role model to many revolutionists in the country.\n\nJai Hind. Jai Shree Ram. Bharat mata ki Jai.",

Savarkar was given a corner cell where he had no access to any outer world. He was made to work for 18 hours a day, given minimum food and minimum clothes. He was made to work for hours without break in oil mill under regimental strictness, he wasn\u2019t allowed to talk to anyone including his brother who was in the same jail. He was tortured on a daily basis by the British officers beating him, abusing him and poking him with hot iron sticks. But Savarkar never broke down even once. He was made to see the hanging of his fellow inmates and freedom fighters to make him mentally weak. He was made to witness the torture of his friends where their head was smacked with iron rods and sticks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was then Savarakar decided to write his views and ideas of nationalism and Hinduism. He was denied access to pen and paper after which he plucked his own nails, collected thorns and pebbles to write on the walls of the cell. He spent 13 years in cellular jail writing endless scripts on nationalism. His famous description of who is Hindu, who is a nationalist was written on the walls of the cells.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He described a Hindu as \u2014 a patriotic inhabitant of Bharatavarsha, venturing beyond a religious identity. He described Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism and Buddhism as one and the same. He outlined his vision of a \u201cHindu Rashtra\u201d (Hindu Nation) as \u201cAkhand Bharat\u201d (United India), purportedly stretching across the entire Indian subcontinent. He defined Hindus as being neither Aryan nor Dravidian but as \u201cPeople who live as children of a common motherland, adoring a common holyland.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally in 1923, due to extreme pressure from Tilak and other prominent leaders, Savarkar was released under strict conditions of not participating in politics for 5 years and barring to leave Ratnagiri district. Savarkar who was barred from participating in politics, focused on abolishing untouchability in the district. He fought for caste unity and achieved 100% success in a span of just 2 years. Dr B.R. Ambedkar who was the editor of the \u2018Janta\u2019, a monthly, was impressed by Savarkar\u2019s work so much that he compared his work to Lord Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He continued his work on nationalism and opposed the Gandhian principles of Ahimsa saying that Indians were not cowards and we cannot beg foreigners for Independence. He strongly pitched for a uniform civil code and strongly opposed the division of India based on religion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Based on Dr B.R. Ambedkar\u2019s writing \u2014 Mr. Savarkar insists that, although there are two nations in India, India shall not be divided into two parts, one for Muslims and the other for the Hindus; that the two nations shall dwell in one country and shall live under the mantle of one single constitution. In the struggle for political power between the two nations, the rule of the game which Mr. Savarkar prescribes is to be one man one vote, be the man Hindu or Muslim. In his scheme, a Muslim is to have no advantage which a Hindu does not have. Minority is to be no justification for privilege and majority is to be no ground for penalty. The state will guarantee the Muslims any defined measure of political power in the form of Muslim religion and Muslim culture. But the State will not guarantee secured seats in the Legislature or in the Administration and, if such guarantee is insisted upon by the Muslims, such guaranteed quota is not to exceed their proportion to the general population.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He wrote more than 8 books in his lifetime and over 10,000 pages in Marathi language. His literary works in Marathi include \u201cKamala\u201c, \u201cMazi Janmathep\u201d (My Life Sentence), and most famously 1857 \u2013 The First War of Independence, in which Savarkar popularised the term \u201cFirst War of Independence.\u201d Kale Pani (Black Water which means \u201clife sentence\u201d on the island prison on the Andaman islands), which reflected the treatment of Indian Independence activists by the British. He wrote an inspirational historical work, Saha Soneri Pane (Six Golden Pages), recounting some of the \u201cGolden periods\u201d of Indian history.  He wrote the atrocities of British and Muslims on Hindu residents in Kerala in the book, Mopalyanche Band (Muslims\u2019 Strike) and also Gandhi Gondhal (Gandhi\u2019s Confusion), a political critique of Gandhi\u2019s politics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His poems include, Sagara pran talmalala (O Great Sea, My Heart Aches for the Motherland), and Jayostute (written in praise of freedom).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He spent his life fighting for the country but was accused by Congress of inciting violence and hatred. But B.R. Ambedkar believed that Savarkar&amp;#39;s way of life and his fight to unite all castes and religions was something which was recognized by very few. Savarak became the victim of political games of Congress which found him as an easy target. But even today, his ideas about nationalism, love for country and the struggle he faced can never be denied and he became a role model to many revolutionists in the country.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jai Hind. Jai Shree Ram. Bharat mata ki Jai.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Which process of ablution has been described in this verse ?**\n\n**Answer 1 :** \"Arjuna bases his argument not on his own personal experience, but on what he has heard from the authorities. That is the way of receiving real knowledge. One cannot reach the real point of factual knowledge without being helped by the right person who is already established in that knowledge. There is a system in the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama institution by which one has to undergo the process of ablution before death for his sinful activities. One who is always engaged in sinful activities must utilize the process of ablution called the pr\u0101ya\u015bcitta. Without doing so, one surely will be transferred to hellish planets to undergo miserable lives as the result of sinful activities.\"  \n**Ref : Bhagavad-Gita 1.43, Purport, Srila Prabhupada**  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uy567xhbu1n41.jpg?width=502&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6147d44b693db9ab360754646d8f11e149f500b6\n\n  \nNow, you can get these QA directly on your Android phone.

At first, I thought I will live here in South for the remaining period of time but now my college has extended the break to two months and due to the given uncertainty of covid19, everyone in my family is forcing me to return to my native place. I have booked the train tickets but I am still afraid about the fact that whether it is safe to do so or not? Will I be putting my family members to the risk of getting infected because of my journey...please suggest what I should do. Also, since I am student I don't cook my own food I order it from outside and I am not sure whether he maintains the quality of the food or will he provide it in case of emergency....please give any suggestions... Thank you. My boarding date is 20/march.",

     "selftext": "First, I want to establish that the scriptures that promote slaughtering atheists are actually canonical Hindu texts and not simply the invention of infidels. Wikipedia has this to say on the Rigveda:\n\n&gt; The Rigveda (Sanskrit: \u090b\u0917\u094d\u0935\u0947\u0926 *\u1e5bgveda*, from *\u1e5bc* \"praise\" and *veda* \"knowledge\") is an ancient Indian collection of Vedic Sanskrit hymns along with associated commentaries on liturgy, ritual and mystical exegesis. **It is one of the four sacred canonical texts (*\u015bruti*) of Hinduism known as the Vedas.**\n\nFor this debate, I use the Ralph T.H. Griffith [1896] English translation of the Rigveda.\n\nBook 9, Hymn XIII:\n\n&gt; PASSED through, the fleece in thousand streams the Soma, purified, flows on to Indra's, Viyu's special place.\n\n&gt; Sing forth, ye men who long for help, to Pavamana, to the Sage, effused to entertain the Gods.\n\n&gt; The Soma-drops with thousand powers are purified for victory,\nHymned to become the feast of Gods.\n\n&gt; Yea, as thou flowest bring great store of food that we may win the spoil Indu, bring splendid manly might.\n\n&gt; May they in flowing give us wealth in thousands, and heroic power,\u2014 These Godlike Soma-drops effused.\n\n&gt; Like coursers by their drivers urged, they were poured forth, for victory, swift through the woollen straining-cloth.\n\n&gt; Noisily flow the Soma-drops, like milch-kine lowing to their calves: They have run forth from both the hands.\n\n&gt; As Gladdener whom Indra loves, O Pavamana, with a roar\nDrive all our enemies away.\n\n&gt; **O Pavamamas, driving off the godless, looking on the light,\nSit in the place of sacrifice.**\n\nHere we see that it is commendable to kill atheists. Other commentators on this text have extended the concept of \"atheist\" in Hindu texts to all non-believers of Hinduism;therefore, Christians are atheists, Buddhists are atheists, Jains are atheists, etc. Therefore, not only is it commendable to kill atheists, but Christians, Buddhists, Jains, Muslims, etc....all are fair game because of their \"atheism\".\n\nBook 7, Hymn VI, Stanza 3:\n\n&gt; **The foolish, faithless, rudely-speaking niggards, without belief or sacrifice or worship**,\u2014 Far far sway hath Agni chased those Dasytis, and, in the cast, hath turned the godless westward.\n\nThis stanza clarifies that the object of revulsion is the atheist, those who do not make sacrifices or offer worship to Lord Ram. Even more interesting is the idea that the godless make their home in the west. This hymn would seem to be setting the scene for some conflict between the followers of the Hinduism and western civilization, which must be either conquered and made to worship Lord Ram, or be expunged.\n\nBook 9, Hymn LXIII, Stanza 5:\n\n&gt;  Performing every noble work, active, augmenting Indra's strength, **driving away the godless ones**.\n\nHere again the faithful are called upon the drive out atheists from among them.\n____________\nAnother interesting set of Hindu scriptures that seek to malign atheists are the Puranas, specifically the *Brahma Puranas*. Much like the Bible or the Quran, which condemn atheists to burn in hell for all eternity for not believing, the Brahma Puranas condemn the atheist to an eternity of torment. Here, I use the G.P. Bhatt [1955] English translation.\n\nChapter 65, verses 71-73:\n\n&gt;  [71] Thus O brahmins is the greatest abode of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u endowed with all enjoyable pleasures and attributes. It is conducive to the pleasures of everyone. It is holy and full of mysteries.\n\n&gt; [72] **Atheists and profligates do not go there.** Nor do the following go there viz.\u2014the ungrateful arid those who are of uncontrollable sense-organs.\n\n&gt; [73] The devotees of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u who worship V\u0101sudeva the preceptor of the universe with devotion, go to the world of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.\n\nHere we see that only the devotees of Visnu (i.e., the Hindu) is rewarded, while the atheist is punished.\n_________\n\nIn this debate, I have shown that the Hindu scriptures promote the killing of atheists (and by extension: Jews, Buddhists, Christians, Muslims, and all non-Hindus). At the very least, one is to be commended for discriminating against atheists according to Hindu scripture. Therefore, the Hindu scriptures do not promote peace or the a concept of religious pluralism.\n____________\n\nIn my next debate, I will show how the Hindu scriptures forbid the Hindu from making friends with or from socializing with infidels (i.e., atheists and non-Hindus).",
